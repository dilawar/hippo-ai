A promising strategy for combating<br />malaria is based on harnessing gene drive systems to spread anti-malarial<br />genes throughout mosquito populations rendering them unable to transmit<br />the parasites.&nbsp; Highly-effective anti-malarial gene cassettes that result<br />in a 100% block of Plasmodium falciparum, the most deadly human malaria<br />parasite, in mosquitoes, were linked to a gene-drive system based on<br />CRISPR/Cas9 biology, and showed in laboratory experiments to spread with<br />99.5% efficiency in Anopheles stephensi, the major malarial vector<br />mosquito in urban India.&nbsp; Strategic planning in selecting field-sites,<br />engineered mosquito strains, trial designs and implementation strategies<br />is needed to achieve a successful first field trial of this technology.<br />The trial should use local scientists and adhere to stringent community<br />engagement and regulatory standards.&nbsp; The trial should have an<br />epidemiological endpoint that results in local disease elimination.</p> <br>  Uncovering Plasticity of Nucleosomes During Chromatin Remodeling Reactions. </br><br><p><br />ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes play essential biological roles by mobilizing nucleosomal DNA. Yet, how DNA is mobilized despite the steric constraints placed by the histone octamer remains unknown. Here,<br />using methyl transverse-relaxation-optimized NMR spectroscopyon a 450 kDa<br />complex, we show that the chromatin remodeler, SNF2h, distorts the histone<br />octamer. Binding of SNF2h in an activated ATP state changes dynamics of<br />buried histone residues. Preventing octamer distortion by site-specific<br />disulfide linkages inhibits nucleosome sliding by SNF2h, while promoting<br />octamer eviction by the SWI/SNF complex, RSC. Our findings indicate that<br />the histone core of a nucleosome is more plastic than previously imagined<br />and that octamer deformation plays different roles based on the type of<br />chromatin remodeler. Octamer plasticity may contribute to chromatin<br />regulation beyond ATP-dependent remodeling.</p> <br> Introduction to Ultra Performance Convergence Chromatograph (UPC2 ) MS/MS </br><br><p>Dr. Abhijit will introduce convergence chromatography technique covering isolation, extraction and preparative supercritical fluid chromatography.

We have<br />been applying cryo-EM to illustrate the architecture of ribonucleoprotein<br />complexes, such as bacterial group II introns and ribosomes. Bacterial<br />group II introns are large ribonucleoprotein complex comprising the intron<br />ribozyme and an intron-encoded protein. They self-splice, yielding mature<br />RNA, and integrate into DNA as retroelements. Recently, the first cryo-EM<br />structure of Lactococcuslactis group IIA intron, in complex with an<br />intron-encoded protein, was resolved at 3.8 &Aring;. Molecular analysis of the<br />cryo-EM structure of the group II intron revealed functional coordination<br />between the intron RNA and protein. In addition, the protein structure<br />revealed a close relationship between its reverse transcriptase catalytic<br />domain and telomerase, while its splicing center resembles the<br />spliceosomal Prp8 protein, suggesting a complex ancestral relationship<br />among these proteins.</p>
<p>Ribosomes, the protein synthesis machineries of the cell, are large<br />macromolecular complexes. The mammalian mitochondria contain its own<br />protein synthesis machinery including ribosomes (mitoribosomes). The<br />mitoribosome contains significantly smaller rRNAs and a larger mass of<br />mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs), including additional 35<br />mito-specific MRPs, as compared to the bacterial ribosome. Most of the<br />mammalian mitochondrial mRNAs are leaderless, i.e., lacking a 5\222UTR and<br />therefore also lacking a Shine-Dalgarno sequence. This situation has some<br />similarity to that in Mycobacterium smegmatis, where about one-third of<br />mRNAs are leaderless. How these leaderless mRNAs are recruited by the<br />ribosomes to initiate protein synthesis is unknown. While the cryo-EM<br />structure of the mitoribosome have yielded the architecture of ribosomal<br />small subunit and existence of the previously eluded one of the<br />tRNA-bindign sites, the E-site, on the mitoribosome, our structural<br />studies of the M. smegmatis 70S ribosome has also revealed some of the<br />unique features of the mycobacterial ribosome. I will summarize results of<br />above studies that I have been currently involved in, and will outline my<br />future research plan to study protein synthesis in Plasmodium falciparum<br />that I would like to pursue as an independent investigator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br> Understanding the role of RDGB in Drosophila Phototransduction </br><br><p>Signalling from many cell surface receptors like G protein<br />coupled receptor (GPCR), receptor tyrosine kinases result in activation of<br />phospholipase C (PLC) enzyme.PLC hydrolyses a phosphor-inositide lipid<br />called phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) at plasma membrane<br />(PM). PIP2 is a versatile lipid which is involved in multiple signalling<br />events like generation of secondary messengers, endocytosis, remodelling<br />of actin cytoskeleton etc therefore maintenance of PIP2 levels at PM is<br />critical to maintain the signalling competence of cells. De novo synthesis<br />of PIP2 takes place from the lipid molecule phosphatidylinositol (PI)<br />which is primarily synthesized in endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However the<br />PI kinases which convert PI into PIP2 are localized at the PM. Hence<br />during sustained PLC activation, which results in rapid PIP2 degradation,<br />the lipid PI must reach PM to restore PIP2 levels. Besides the vesicular<br />mode of lipid transfer, this process also requires the activity of a group<br />of proteins called PI transfer proteins (PITPs). The in vivo mechanism of<br />action of PITPs was not elucidated till date.</p>
<p>Hence during sustained PLC activation, which results in rapid PIP2<br />degradation, the lipid PI must reach PM to restore PIP2 levels. Besides<br />the vesicular mode of lipid transfer,this process also requires the<br />activity of a group of proteins called PI transfer proteins (PITPs). The<br />in vivo mechanism of action of PITPs was not elucidated till date. The aim<br />of this thesis work was to understand the cellular role of a PITP called<br />RDGB (Retinal Degeneration B) and to find the mechanism of action of this<br />protein in vivo. Work presented in this thesis shows a detailed<br />characterization of the phenotypes resulting from loss of RDGB in<br />photoreceptors. We show that RDGB activity is essential to resynthesize<br />PIP2 at PM post its depletion by PLCusing an in vivo live pseudopupil<br />imaging assay. We show that the PI transfer domain (PITPd) of RDGB has<br />ability to bind and transfer two lipids namely PI and phosphatidic acid<br />(PA). PI binding is important for the function in vivo and lipid transfer<br />event relies on an intact tryptophan motif. We show that RDGB is a<br />membrane tethered PITP which is localized to a specific compartment within<br />photoreceptors called sub microvillar cisternae (SMC). We show that this<br />SMC specific localization of RDGB is physiologically important andit helps<br />to increase the local concentration of the protein near the base of PM<br />where its function is required. This localization is determined by the<br />interaction of its FFAT motif with the VAP-A protein of ER. Altogether our<br />results show that RDGB represents a tethered PITP that functions at PM-ER<br />membrane contact site to maintain lipid homeostasis during PLC signalling.<br />Further using Drosophila photoreceptors as a model, we asked the basic<br />cell biological question of how PM-ER membrane contact sites are made in<br />cells. We used electrophysiological assay to test the role of 11 potential<br />candidate proteins in establishing PM-ER contact sites in photoreceptors.<br />The results provide important information regarding the multi-factorial<br />nature of membrane contact site establishment in cells and provide useful<br />avenues for future research.</p>

The classical mode<br />of PXR activation involves its binding to appropriate ligand and<br />subsequent heterodimerization with its partner RXR. However emerging<br />evidences suggest various factors such as post-translational modifications<br />and crosstalk with different cellular factors may also modulate the<br />functional dynamics and behavior of PXR. We have for the first time<br />identified that TIP60 (a member of MYST family) interacts with unliganded<br />PXR and together this complex promotes cell migratory and adhesion<br />properties. TIP60 is a lysine acetyltransferase protein that can acetylate<br />both histone and non-histone proteins and participates in many cellular<br />processes. TIP60 induces PXR acetylation specifically at lysine 170<br />located within the LBD region PXR and alters its intranuclear<br />localization. TIP60 utilizes its NR (Nuclear Receptor) Box to mediate its<br />interaction with PXR LBD. Importantly, RXR which is an obligatory<br />interacting partner of ligand bound PXR is not required for the<br />interaction between PXR and TIP60 and this complex does not induce<br />transactivation of ligand-dependent PXR target gene related to xenobiotic<br />metabolism. Understanding how TIP60 could modulate subcellular dynamics of<br />unliganded PXR and ascertaining the cellular functions regulated by this<br />novel complex will expand our knowledge about physiological and<br />pathophysiological implications mediated through this complex.</p> <br> Automating Mathematics?

It has been observed that certain cell types such as<br />Dictyostelium and cancer cells tend to migrate by forming blebs rather<br />than pseudopodia in mechanically resistive environment encountered during<br />tissue invasion or under stiff hydrogel. However, very little is known<br />about the mechanical factors which lead to plasticity incell migration.<br />Also, the key mechanosensing components governing this transition are yet<br />to be deciphered.</p>
<p>In the first part of the talk, I will introduce the \221cell squasher\222 which<br />was designed to apply a defined uniaxial compressive load on chemotacting<br />cells. A pressure of only 100 Pa was sufficient to switch Dictyostelium<br />cells from moving predominantly with pseudopods to bleb-driven migration.<br />Next, I will describe a novel underlying mechanosensing signalling pathway<br />involving Piezo stretch-operated channels. The response to the load is<br />also accompanied by an increase in cytosolic calcium and augmentation of<br />myosin-II dependent contractility, both being dependent on Piezo.</p>
<p>My talk explores the contributions of two key mechanical factors that<br />trigger this switch, the environment's stiffness and its state of stress<br />and demonstrate an involvement of a novel mechanotransductive pathway<br />involved in sensing these mechanical cues.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> <br> Mechanisms of social organization in honeybees (Apis mellifera) </br><br><p>Division of labor is a hallmark of social insects. In honeybees,<br />social&nbsp;organization involves sequential transition of sterile female workers<br />from&nbsp;one task to the next. While young bees remain in the center of the<br />nest&nbsp;and provide food for the larvae (Â“nurse beesÂ”), older bees&nbsp;produce wax and&nbsp;build new combs (Â“buildersÂ”), or remove dead bees from the&nbsp;colony<br />(Â“undertakersÂ”). The oldest bees of a colony leave the hive and&nbsp;become<br />foragers. Among the foragers, some bees collect pollen, others collect<br />nectar and again others forage for water. The social organization of&nbsp;a<br />honeybee colony is highly plastic and can rapidly adjust to changes&nbsp;in the<br />environment or within the hive. How the complex and yet plastic&nbsp;division<br />of labor is regulated is still a mystery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to a recent hypothesis, workers performing different tasks&nbsp;should differ in their sensory response thresholds for task-related&nbsp;stimuli. Individuals whose response threshold is exceeded, begin to&nbsp;perform the associated task. Division of labor works, because&nbsp;individuals&nbsp;of a colony differ in their sensory response thresholds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our data provide direct support for this hypothesis, showing that&nbsp;bees<br />performing different tasks in the hive indeed differ in their sensory&nbsp;response thresholds. Looking for molecular mechanisms underlying&nbsp;division<br />of labor in honeybees, we identified a number of candidate genes for<br />sensory responsiveness and division of labor. These genes include the&nbsp;nutrition-related foraging gene, Amfor, and genes encoding for&nbsp;biogenic<br />amine receptors. We show that bees performing different tasks differ&nbsp;in<br />the expression of these genes. Activating the respective proteins&nbsp;pharmacologically modulates sensory responsiveness of bees.<br />Immunohistochemistry with our specific antibodies against the&nbsp;respective<br />proteins reveals their expression in brain areas involved in the&nbsp;processing and integration of sensory information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taken together, our data suggest that the foraging gene and different&nbsp;biogenic amine receptor genes are involved in the regulation of&nbsp;division&nbsp;of labor through modulating sensory response thresholds.</p> <br> Understanding Protein Structure and Function through Computational Folding of Coarse-Grained Models </br><br><p>Amino acids which are important for the function of a protein are not available for optimizing its folding and stability, leading to a trade-off which optimizes function over folding. This implies that functional amino acids in proteins can cause detectable effects on protein folding energy landscapes. In this thesis, we utilize the existence, or absence of the impact of functional residues on folding energy landscapes to better understand protein structure and function.</p>
<p>In this work, we have used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of SBMs to understand the function of (A) the human interleukins, IL-33 and IL-1beta, (B) E.coli Adenylate kinase (AKE) and (C) human alpha1-antitrypsin (alpha1-AT) by characterizing the folding free energy landscapes of their wild-type and mutant proteins.</p>
<p>(A) Interleukins IL-33 and IL-1beta are involved in immune responses to infections and injury in humans. Both proteins have a similar beta-trefoil structure, but their amino acid sequence encodes different functions. MD simulations of their SBMs revealed that IL-33 has a lower barrier to folding than IL-1beta. We found that the structural deviations responsible for this difference are present in their folding cores, and arise from the loss of interactions that are conserved across several beta-trefoil proteins. These conserved interactions are lost to accommodate function in IL-33 and IL-1beta. However, the functional requirements in IL-33 require a greater loss of such interactions than those seen in IL-1beta. Therefore, the differences in the functions of IL-33 and IL-1beta requires different structural perturbations in their folding cores, and this leads to differences in their folding free energy barriers.</p>
<p>(B) Protein folding cooperativity leads to all-or-nothing folding, reduces the population of partially folded intermediates and therefore, reduces aggregation propensity. We examined the three-domain protein, E. coli Adenylate kinase (AKE), to understand the structural features that facilitate its folding cooperativity. By using MD simulations of SBMs of AKE and its mutants we found that in contrast to most multi-domain proteins, inter-domain interactions in AKE do not facilitate folding cooperativity. Further analysis revealed that two of the three domains of AKE are not connected by single amino acid linkers, but are inserted into the third domain. The folding of circular permutants of AKE which modify this domain-connectivity to convert the inserted-domains into singly-linked domains showed that domain insertion facilitates folding cooperativity in AKE. Using a computational assay for function, we find that domain interfaces are important for function while domain insertion is important for folding cooperativity. Further, an analysis of protein structures revealed that this could be a design principle inherent to several other multi-domain proteins as well.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br />(C) For many proteins, alternative native conformations facilitate functional partitioning into active and inactive states. Human alpha1-antitrypsin (alpha1-AT) is a protease inhibitor that must fold to a metastable, active conformation and avoid folding to a more stable, latent conformation. The active conformation exposes the functional reactive center loop (RCL) which is buried in the latent conformation. Using MD simulations of the SBMs of active and latent alpha1-AT we found that folding to the latent conformation entails a larger free energy barrier as compared to folding to the active one. The early formation of the exposed RCL facilitates a lower folding barrier relative to the early formation of a buried RCL. Therefore, the exposed conformation of the RCL determines both folding and functional fate in alpha1-AT.</p>
<p>In summary, (A) we examined the trade-off between folding and function in IL-33 and IL-1beta, (B) showed how the folding function trade-off is avoided in a multi-domain protein, AKE by domain insertion and (C) identified that functional constraints in alpha1-AT are so large that it facilitates folding to the less stable active conformation. We conclude that examining folding landscapes of proteins can be a facile way to gain unique insights into their function.</p>

<p></p> <br>  Rejuvenating Cellular Respiration for Optimising Respiratory Health - Targeting Mitochondria. </br><br><p>The last three decades have seen sharp concurrent increase in the<br />incidence of obesity, cardiometabolic disease and asthma, with strong<br />epidemiological associations. Common origins can be traced to mitochondria<br />- powerhouses of cells,sensors of threats, and effectors of cell danger<br />responses. The talk will focus on the evidence for a mitochondrial link<br />connecting obesity and asthma, the efficacy of mitochondrial targeted<br />therapies in lung diseases, and the therapeutic potential of mesenchymal<br />stem cells as mitochondrial donors. The possibility of a gut-lung axis,<br />operating via a microbiome-mitochondria link, will be briefly discussed.</p>
<p></p> <br> Microbes meet cancer: Role of Streptococcus gallolyticus in colorectal tumor development. </br><br><p>The human intestinal microbiome contains more than 1000 different species<br />of bacteria. This diverse microbiota exerts both beneficial and<br />detrimental effects on host health. There is increasing evidence that some<br />bacterial species from gut microbiota contribute to colorectal cancer<br />(CRC). A number of studies have indicated that Streptococcus gallolyticus<br />is associated with human colorectal carcinoma, but whether this is a cause<br />or effect remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that S. gallolyticus can<br />stimulate human CRC cell proliferation compared to untreated cells or<br />those incubated with Lactobacillus lactis. A significant increase was<br />observed in expression of &amp;#946;-catenin, c-Myc, PCNA and cyclin D1 in CRC cell lines under co-culture conditions. S. gallolyticus interacts with<br />extracellular matrix (ECM) and alters the Hippo and Wnt pathway. In the<br />cell line based assay, S. gallolyticus interaction with the components of<br />ECM is critical for its action as CRC promoting bacteria. We also observed<br />that S. gallolyticus cells from stationary phase have more prominent<br />effect on proliferation compared to cells harvested from exponential phase<br />of growth. CRC cells treated with S. gallolyticus form bigger tumors<br />compared to controls in Xenograft model. We use azoxymethane (AOM) model of CRC to show that S. gallolyticus promotes tumor growth and tumor burden in A/J mice. The concept that microbes are involved in the development of CRC is gaining recognition, raising hope that we may be able to exploit knowledge about microbes to improve cancer diagnosis and treatment by incorporating microbes into clinical strategies. To achieve this goal, a clear understanding of how precisely microbes exert their influence on tumor development is required. This study exhibits the role of S.<br />gallolyticus in cancer development.</p> <br> Testicular Development And Protection Of Germ Cell Damage By Dietary Turmeric And/Or Insulin in Diabetic Rats </br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The effect of diabetes on the first wave of spermatogenesis and reproductive function was studied. The 10-day old Wistar pups rendered diabetic using Streptozotocin (STZ) were monitored for 50, 100 and 150 days of age. The onset of diabetes at a young age did not alter the first wave of spermatogenesis and changes observed in quantitative and/or qualitative spermatogenesis were observed after 100 days. The poor fertility status of diabetic rats was associated with decrease in epididymal weight and spermatogonial proliferation, reduced sonication-resistant spermatids, decreased mitochondrial activity leading to reduced sperm motility and increase in sperm DNA damage. These results suggest that longer exposure of testis to high blood sugar will reduce quantitative and qualitative spermatogenesis as well as reproductive performance.</p>
<p>The protection of diabetes-induced germ cell damage by dietary turmeric and/or insulin in adult rats was studied. STZ-induced diabetic rats exhibited quantitatively and qualitatively poor spermatogenesis. The adult diabetic rats were treated with dietary turmeric and/or insulin for 50 days. The body weight and blood glucose of dietary turmeric treated diabetic rats was not restored to normal levels whereas insulin could maintain both. However, turmeric could restore testicular weight to the same extent as insulin. The spermatogonial proliferation was highest in diabetic rats that were co-treated with dietary turmeric and insulin compared to rats treated with either turmeric or insulin alone. Treatment of diabetic rats with either turmeric or insulin or combined treatment improved mitochondrial activity of sperm. Sperm DNA integrity and ROS was preserved with insulin treatment compared to turmeric or combined treatment groups. These results indicate that turmeric was able to provide limited or no protection in either reducing elevated blood glucose levels or improving the spermatogenic parameters studied.</p>

<p></p> <br> Long-term stability of behaviourally relevant dynamics in neural circuits. </br><br><p>Skills ranging from tying one's shoelaces to acing a tennis serve require<br />hundreds to thousands of hours of practice to master, but once perfected,<br />can be retained for the long-term. However, we know little about the<br />learning algorithms that transform the variable and imprecise actions of<br />novices into the fluid, stereotyped movements of experts, nor how such<br />algorithms are implemented in neural circuits. Addressing these questions<br />requires high-resolution tracking of both behaviour and the activity of<br />neuronal populations continuously over weeks and months. Such experiments&nbsp;face significant technical challenges, including processing vast amounts&nbsp;of neural and behavioural data.</p>
<p>I will present a low-cost, fully automated experimental platform that<br />allows neural activity and behaviour to be recorded continuously over<br />several months. The terabyte-sized datasets we generate are parsed using a&nbsp;novel processing pipeline in which the key step is a spike-sorting<br />algorithm that can automatically identify and track single neuron activity<br />in such recordings despite non-stationarity of their spike-waveforms. I<br />used our system to record activity of large populations of single neurons<br />in motor circuits including the motor cortex and striatum, often tracking<br />individual neurons for several weeks. In conjunction with the neural<br />recordings, I acquired high-resolution behavioural data that was used to<br />identify epochs of sleep, rest, grooming, feeding, and to track and<br />quantify movement kinematics during execution of a skilled motor task. I<br />found that average firing rates and correlation structure in neuronal<br />populations were stable across many days, even as they varied across<br />different behavioural states in a single day. Additionally, I found the<br />motor representations of skilled behaviours to be remarkably stable at the<br />single unit level, even over month-long timescales. These results<br />demonstrate that neural circuits can maintain distinct task<br />representations with long-term stability at the level of single neurons.</p>
<p></p> <br> Memories of underdevelopment: Higher Education and India's Universities. </br><br><p>A consensus in academic circles in India seems to be that India's<br />universities have not played - since Independence - as significant a role<br />in higher education, especially in science education, as was both needed<br />and achievable. The state of higher education is widely criticised as a<br />policy failure of a bumbling bureaucracy. In this lecture, an alternate<br />approach would describe a different, and primarily historical, perspective<br />of a complex social, political and economic reality as well as foreign<br />policy imperatives during and immediately after India's independence.<br />Rethinking India's pre-independence past is useful in understanding the<br />present and making guesses about the future. It is unlikely that the<br />educational framework the institutions and their governance structure -<br />will change significantly anytime soon even though coherent, sustainable<br />and pluralist policy alternatives are urgently needed to address the<br />looming "human-climate" calamity in the country. One, among many such<br />alternatives, is a return to a not-so-distant-but-scarcely-remembered<br />past, with selective refinements.</p>

<p></p> <br> Role of folding intermediate states in initiating aggregation of the prion protein </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Conformational conversion of functional mammalian proteins into non-functional aggregated forms, commonly termed as amyloids, form the basis of the largest group of protein conformational diseases known as amyloidosis. Typically characterized by deposition of fibrillar aggregates of specific proteins or peptides as extra-cellular plaques or intracellular inclusion bodies in organs, amyloidosis is mostly fatal. Despite etiological differences, the underlying feature of amyloidosis at the molecular level is the misfolding of proteins and the remarkable similarities in structural arrangements of the fibrillar end products formed by various proteins suggest certain common mechanisms of conformational conversion to be operative.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of all known amyloidosis, transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) provide an additional, interesting facet to the problem of protein misfolding that, it is the only form of amyloidosis which is unambiguously known to be infectious in nature. TSEs are caused by the misfolding and conformational conversion of the innocuous, cellular prion protein, PrP<sup>C</sup> into toxic, aggregated PrP<sup>Sc</sup> forms which result in fatal, neurological conditions in mammals. Importantly, ~85% of prionpathies are however a result of de novo misfolding of PrP<sup>C</sup>, the mechanisms of which are not well understood. Since the crux of the problem lies at the propensity of the prion protein to misfold, it is crucial that the folding mechanisms of the protein are studied in detail, keeping in light the following questions: Why does the prion protein exhibit such high susceptibility to spontaneous conformational conversion from its native structure to alternative misfolded forms?&nbsp; What are the features in the sequence of the protein which makes it amenable to conformational conversion? Which are the potential regions in the sequence where misfolding of the protein initiates from? Does initiation of such misfolding events occur from the native state, or are there high energy conformations whose properties favor inter-molecular association? What are the energetic and structural properties of such high energy conformations? Are these conformations obligatory to the folding of the protein, or are they off-pathway intermediates?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this thesis work, the full-length and truncated variants of the recombinant murine prion protein have been used to investigate the questions posited above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;<strong>Brief Results:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;1. &nbsp;Thermodynamic characterization of unfolding of the full-length murine prion protein using circular dichroism and calorimetric studies revealed that the native state of the protein undergoes large structural fluctuations under conditions that promote misfolding. Large structural fluctuations enable access to high energy conformations or intermediate states that could be aggregation prone (Moulick, R. &amp; Udgaonkar, J. B., 2014, Biophys. J.).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. Native-state hydrogen exchange monitored by mass spectrometry and NMR was used to detect and structurally characterize the high energy intermediate states. These studies identified two high energy partially unfolded intermediate conformations (PUFs) that are populated as a result of the stochastic fluctuations of the native state. (Moulick, R., Das, R. &amp; Udgaonkar, J. B., 2015, J. Biol. Chem.).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. &nbsp;By mutating at the hydrophobic core of the N-terminally truncated&nbsp;prion protein, an intermediate conformation, &lsquo;I&rsquo; was populated at equilibrium. This intermediate was identified to be the monomeric precursor which directly initiates misfolding and oligomerization of the prion protein and was observed to be structurally and energetically identical to one of the PUFs identified in the previous study. Thus, the conformation&nbsp;which initiates misfolding of the protein was identified. (Moulick, R. &amp; Udgaonkar, J. B., 2017, J. Mol. Biol.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4. &nbsp; In order to identify if &lsquo;I&rsquo; was obligatory to the folding of the protein, studies of the folding pathways of the N-terminally truncated protein were carried out under a wide range of solvent conditions using a microsecond mixing device. These studies reveal that multiple folding/unfolding pathways operate in misfolding promoting solvent conditions and the intermediate &lsquo;I&rsquo; is a common intermediate which acts like a branching point to folding and misfolding of the protein.

<p style="text-align: justify;"></p> <br> Single-cell Measurement of Microbial Stress-response Dynamics in Complex Growth Conditions. </br><br><p>Microbial stress-response systems have been closely characterized at a<br />molecular level in some organisms, but little is still known about their<br />dynamics, particularly at the individual-cell level under gradually<br />changing conditions. The technical challenge is that such analyses require<br />single-cell assays that operate under tight control of complex growth<br />conditions with high sensitivity. In fact, some control molecules have<br />such low concentrations as to be hard to measure with conventional<br />methods, and some key events occur so rarely as to be hard to observe.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here we take an interdisciplinary approach to study the stress responses<br />of the model organisms Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis Â– two<br />bacteria separated by a billion years of evolution Â– with the goal of<br />identifying quantitative principles and connecting underlying molecular<br />mechanisms to dynamics and control in single cells. We have developed a<br />novel microfluidic platform that allows us to measure growth-rate and<br />gene-expression dynamics (16 different genes simultaneously) of individual<br />cells under both constant and systematically changing conditions along<br />bacterial growth-curves. We can also increase throughput by orders of<br />magnitude, tracking 105 parallel lineages from early exponential phase to<br />deep stationary phase and even through multiple cycles of entering and<br />exiting stationary phase, which allows us to detect extremely rare events.<br />By monitoring the growth physiology and the dynamics of reporters for key<br />regulators of stress-response, we are trying to pinpoint both the<br />regulatory principles and the roles of the underlying molecular<br />mechanisms. The talk will discuss the method development, novel findings,<br />and their implications in understanding bacterial stress-response.</p>
<p></p> <br> Indian Crows in an Urban Context: Writing the environmental history of a companionate species </br><br><p>How can environmental historians connect with the common reader to make species extinction feel real?&nbsp;A well-worn strategy is to narrate the twilight of&nbsp;a cherished animal on the brink. This has been done wonderfully well for&nbsp;India&rsquo;s tigers and elephants, but my project goes in another direction and&nbsp;studies the decline of the common Indian house crow, Corvus splendens,&nbsp;a native species whose terrain crosses all of So&shy;&shy;uth Asia. Unlike tigers and elephants, Indian house&nbsp;crows eschew the jungle for villages and towns; in fact, house crows are India&rsquo;s most persistent companionate species and have always flourished side by side with humans in villages and cities.Yet crows have recently begun to disappear, triggering popular and environmentalist concerns. While biologists usually blame falling bird numbers on over-hunting or habitat loss or the lethal blows of industrialization, such pressures do not weigh unduly on house crows, which are never hunted, often indulged and hand-fed and frequently worshipped. So why are house crows disappearing from, for instance, Allahabad, Udaipur, Mysore and a dozen other major cities&mdash;but not from Kolkata, Mumbai or New Delhi? Using the archival resources of social history, the observational methods of ethnography, and the philosophical premises of&nbsp;post-humanism, my project will explore India&rsquo;s deep attachment to house crows and the distressed reactions to the bird&rsquo;s disappearance.</p> <br> The evolutionary and developmental origins of a major transition to obligate endosymbiosis in ants. </br><br><p>Endosymbiosis, where one distantly related species lives inside the body or cells of the other, is wide spread in nature. The evolution of obligate endosymbiosis represents a major transition in evolution because host and endosymbiont lose their ability to replicate independently. They also integrate developmentally transforming their relationship from conflict to cooperation. However, the evolutionary steps to developmental integration and obligate endosymbiosis remain unknown. The bacteria <em>Blochmannia</em> colonized the hyperdiverse ant genus <em>Camponotus</em> (carpenter ants) from the distantly related true bugs (Hemiptera), and evolved into an obligate endosymbiosis nearly forty million years ago. In all ants, the embryo (germ disc) and germline form at the posterior pole of the egg. I and my collaboratorsfound that colonization of germplasmby <em>Blochmannia</em> drove evolution of radical alterations in the early embryo &ndash; formation of the embryo in the anterior, evolution of bacteriocytes at the posterior pole and a novel germline. Using gene expression, antibiotic treatment, and RNA interference, we show that these radical alterations evolved through two evolutionary steps: An initialduplication and divergence of germplasm that resolved an ancient conflict present in true bugs between endosymbionts and host over development of the embryonic posterior. A second duplication and divergence event allowing developmental integration of <em>Blochmannia</em> into <em>Camponotus</em> through co-option of ancestral germplasm for patterning of bacteriocytes &ndash; cells that harbor <em>Blochmannia</em> &ndash; and the evolution of a novel germline for vertical transmission of <em>Blochmannia</em>. We discovered that these two duplication and divergence events were driven by evolution of maternal expression and function of Hox genes, which required a re-wiring of the highly-conserved segmentation gene network. Therefore, the evolutionary steps to developmental integration and cooperation between endosymbiont and host occurred through duplication followed by functional divergence of pre-existing organs and rewiring of ancient developmental pathways. This may be a general feature of major transitions to obligate endosymbiosis and a key factor in the success of carpenter ants.</p> <br> Visualizing dynamic cellular machinery with electron microscopy </br><br><p>In spite of recent technological advancements in transmission electron<br />microscopy (EM), determining structures of flexible macromolecules<br />continue to be a major challenge. We show how EM can be used to elucidate<br />structural details of cellular macromolecules of different sizes and<br />complexities, and involved in diverse biological functions. The largest of<br />these is the microtubule (MT) associated dynein-dynactin (DD) complex<br />(~2.6 MDa in size), whose conformational flexibility has stymied structure<br />determination for decades. By combining 2D and 3D EM analyses, we obtained<br />structural snapshots of isolated dynein complex and DD complexes attached<br />to MTs. From our analyses we not only discerned the first molecular<br />details of native dynein, but also observed unique orientations of<br />dynactin relative to the dynein tail, with the dynein heads positioned<br />uni-directionally on MTs. This suggests a mechanism of overcoming<br />autoinhibited conformation of dynein. While these studies provide<br />domain-level resolution, we also used EM to determine atomic-level<br />details. To answer how phages evade the CRISPR-based bacterial defense<br />system, we obtained near-atomic resolution reconstruction of phage-encoded<br />anti-CRISPRs (ACRs) bound to the P. aeruginosa type I-F CRISPR-crRNA<br />surveillance complex (~450kDa in size). New image processing techniques<br />were used to overcome the intrinsic structural heterogeneity of the<br />complex, revealing for the first time structural details of the type IF<br />CRISPR surveillance complex, and also explaining the molecular mechanism<br />by which ACRs prevent binding of phage DNA to the CRISPR complex.</p>
<p></p> <br> Our gut microbiota: friend or foe? </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Our long-standing evolutionary association with microbial communities in the gastrointestinal tract has developed into an intimate relationship which governs many aspects of human health. Some of the key functions of our gut microbiota are maintenance of intestinal homeostasis, training the host immune system and tuning intestinal morphogenesis. Shifts in these microbial communities by various internaland external factors including ageing, diet or invasion by enteric pathogenscan perturb this homeostasis,leading to increased risk of gastrointestinal diseases including cancer. Our recent findings indicate that intestinal stem cell signaling plays a pivotal role in gut associated tumor development. However,it remains largely unknown how the gut microbes or pathogens crosstalk with the various intestinal cells,especially the stem cellsand influence their signaling during health or disease. My research in the recent years had been centered at understanding the interrelationship between microbiota, pathogens and the gastrointestinal tract and its impact on the host. I will briefly outline some of my recent findings in my talk.</p> <br> A competition mechanism positions non-membrane-bound organelles in cells. </br><br><p>Cell organelles must be in the right place at the right time to do their job. While some organelles&nbsp;are bound by membranes, others are not. Cells transport membrane-bound organelles like trucks<br />on a highway. Membranes are important for transport since &lsquo;trucks&rsquo; of specialized motor proteins dock to the organelle membranes and transport them as cargo along &lsquo;highways&rsquo; of cytoskeletal tracks. But how then do cells transport the other class of organelles, which are liquid-like and&nbsp;lack a surrounding membrane? How do you position a water droplet, so to speak?</p>
<p>We can make water droplets by cooling water vapor, but it is quite difficult to see how this can&nbsp;be done specifically at one place or another. A simple way could be to heat one end of a closed<br />chamber while cooling the other end. Water droplets evaporate from the hot end and condense at&nbsp;the cold end. We discovered that cells use a similar mechanism to position liquid-like &lsquo;P granule&rsquo;&nbsp;organelles to one of its two poles, a process critical for fertility in the worm <em>C. elegans.</em> Signals&nbsp;from the cell-polarity system concentrate a regulator protein at one of the two poles of the <em>C.&nbsp;elegans</em> early embryos. This regulator protein dissolves P granules. The dissolved material at one&nbsp;pole then recondenses as P granules at the other pole where the regulator concentration is low.</p>
<p>While trying to understand how the regulator dissolves P granules, we discovered that a novel&nbsp;competition mechanism is at the heart of this problem. P granule proteins must bind to&nbsp;messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules to make P granules. It turns out that the regulator and the P&nbsp;granule proteins compete for these mRNA molecules, such that P granules dissolve when the<br />regulator protein sequesters mRNA molecules away from the P granule proteins. This competition mechanism represents a powerful way, distinct from &lsquo;trucks on a highway&rsquo;-based<br />transport, of organizing the spatial distribution of liquid-like RNA-protein organelles in cells.</p> <br> Membrane tension: an universal mechanical signal for cell shape changes, from 2D to 3D environment and beyond... </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">This seminar will focus on the role of the mechanical signal exerted by plasma membrane tension on cell shape changes. I will present how we unveiled that cells like fibroblasts rely on membrane tension to exert a feedback loop on several biological functions important for cell shape changes and migration. I will also discuss how this mechanical signal of tension is in fact universal and can also be at the heart of understanding immune responses like phagocytosis. Finally I will present how those mechanobiology principles are also potentially implicated in 3D migrations.</p>

However, they exploit their host cells in the replication and virion assembly processes to generate diversity in virion structures. We are interested in how they use the host to generate this diversity and whether this diversity of structure plays a role in the virus life cycle and if it influences the pathogenesis of these important human viruses. Our recent studies of Zika and dengue viruses will be the main topics for discussion.The cryo-electron microscopy structures of mature and immature forms of Zika virus as well as virus bound to a potent human neutralizing monoclonal antibody will be presented.</p> <br> When individuals matter: Biodiversity and the impacts of logging in Borneo </br><br><p>The functional component of biodiversity that has seen much recent attention, where a species&rsquo; morphological, physiological and behavioural traits relate to its function in an ecosystem and at a community-level, combine to form the functional diversity of a system, analogous to ecosystem health. But biodiversity is a multifaceted concept, encompassing not only natural variation in species&rsquo; traits between species, but between individuals of the same species (intraspecific trait variation). This within-species variation is important for a range of ecological and evolutionary processes. Even so, the greatest limitation of functional diversity measurement to-date remains the inability to account for such intraspecific trait variation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here, I introduce a newly developed simulation approach, which uses bootstrapping to produce a range of ecologically feasible functional diversity values when accounting for intraspecific trait variation. I also present a method to quantify the confidence that should be placed in observed differences when comparing the functional diversity of two communities. I apply this method to data on the biodiversity of two bird communities in Borneo; one in primary (unlogged) forest and one in selectively-logged forest. By accounting for intraspecific variation, I was able to reveal previously unrecognised negative impacts of logging on avian functional diversity in this ecosystem, further shedding light on how humans are modifying natural ecosystems globally.</p> <br> Sugar influx sensing by the phosphotransferase system (PTS) of Escherichia coli. </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">The phosphotransferase system (PTS) plays a pivotal role in the uptake of multiple sugars in Escherichia coli and many other bacteria. In the cell, individual sugar-specific PTS branches are interconnected through a series of phosphotransfer reactions, thus creating a global network that not only phosphorylates incoming sugars but also regulates a number of cellular processes. Despite the apparent importance of the PTS network in bacterial physiology, the holistic function of the network in the cell remains unclear. We used F&ouml;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to investigate the PTS network in E. coli, including the dynamics of protein interactions and the processing of different stimuli and their transmission to the chemotaxis pathway. Our results demonstrate that despite the seeming complexity of the cellular PTS network, its core part operates in a strikingly simple way, sensing the overall influx of PTS sugars irrespective of the sugar identity and distributing this information equally through all studied branches of the network. Moreover, it also integrates several other specific metabolic inputs. The integrated output of the PTS network is then transmitted linearly to the chemotaxis pathway, in stark contrast to the amplification of conventional chemotactic stimuli. Finally, we observe that default uptake through the uninduced PTS network correlates well with the quality of the carbon source, apparently representing an optimal regulatory strategy.</p> <br> Human iPS cells derived macrophages and other tissues to model organ-specific infections and inflammatory diseases </br><br><p>Macrophages are professional phagocytes of innate immune system. During early embryonic development macrophages are seeded into different tissues, locally proliferate and self-renew to maintain a resident pool throughout life. By responding to specific tissue micro-environment, resident macrophages acquire unique phenotypic and functional features that promote tissue homeostasis and organ physiology. Defects in such trophic/homeostatic function of macrophages leads to many tissue specific pathologies. By contrast, in response to microbial/sterile insults or immunological stimuli macrophages become activated and initiate an inflammatory response which is essential for host defence; but if not tightly regulated that can lead to immuno-pathologies and collateral tissue damage.</p>
<p>Many pathogens selectively infect humans and have their unique tissue tropism; and most inflammatory disorders have their own organ specific features. The GWAS and other human genetic studies have identified a large number of genetic variants associated with human infection and inflammatory diseases which require functional validation. Thus improved experimental model is required to study tissue-specific macrophage function in the context of human infections and inflammatory disorders by rapid functional validation of gene candidates identified for these diseases.</p>
<p>To address this, I have developed methods to differentiate human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into variety of innate immune cells (macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophil), non-immune cells (white and brown adipocytes, hepatocytes) and complex organotypic cultures ( intestinal and lung organoids). By combining gene editing technology and complex 3D co-culture models between iPS derived macrophages and other tissues I am studying tissue specific macrophage function in the context of human infection and inflammatory diseases. I will discuss our experimental strategy, technologies and resources available in our laboratory. I will show selected examples of new discoveries we made in macrophage immunobiology through this approach specifically focusing on i) adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance, ii) enteric infection and inflammatory bowel disease.</p> <br> Multiscale modeling of homeostatic plasticity </br><br><p>We addressed the question how individual neurons in an active network change their properties over time. For that, we analyzed recordings obtained with a recently developed electrode array with both a high&nbsp; number and density of electrodes (4096 electrodes on 2.56 x 2.56 mm) to&nbsp; measure neuronal activity at an almost cellular resolution. To reduce the size of the datasets and to assess the level of noise in the recordings, we first designed and tested a spike detection algorithm that combines signals from several electrodes and spatially localizes the detected spikes.</p>
<p>We further characterized the population activity in neuronal cultures with the aim to explain and account for the nonstationarities and neuronal diversity in our recordings. This analysis resulted in a preliminary model or cartoon of the burst dynamics in three weeks old neuronal cultures. Furthermore, it indicated that the network activity before a spike may not be a good predictor for spiking in an individual neuron, due to inhibition and intrinsic dynamics mediated by voltage gated ion channels.</p>
<p>Assuming that neurons locally received a similar synaptic input, we therefore determined local activity levels at the time of each spike and related these to the excitability of a neuron. We quantified local changes over days, under application of a low dose of a competitive synaptic blocker and after a replacement of the culture media. This analysis showed that average excitability levels are correlated after <br />days without intervention, but that a replacement of the culture media reorganized the network and only few spots maintained their excitability.</p>
<p>Finally, we determined whether retinal waves during development&nbsp; homogeneously cover the retina. It is the case early in development. Before eye opening, however, regions permitting the propagation of retinal waves were alternating on a timescale of hours.</p> <br> CRAC channels Ca2+ microdomains in NFAT activation and gene expression. </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Although a vast number of chemical signals are employed on the cell surface, only a small number of&nbsp;intracellular messengers are achieved into physiological consequences. Among them intracellular calcium&nbsp;is the most widespread, activating a range of fundamental cellular responses including gene expression,&nbsp;neurotransmission, beating of the heart, autophagy and apoptosis. Many different processes are activated&nbsp;by the same message, raising the question how elevation of intracellular calcium triggers a specific&nbsp;cellular response. Our aspiration is to understand how specificity is achieved in the immune system. Our&nbsp;research demonstrates that the formation of a store dependent signaling complex in the plasma membrane&nbsp;provides for selective activation of a fundamental downstream response by calcium released activated&nbsp;calcium channel (CRAC). CRAC channels are the major route for Ca2+ entry in all eukaryotic cells. The&nbsp;molecular basis of the CRAC channel has been identified, with STIM1 (ER resident protein) and ORAI1&nbsp;(plasma membrane pore forming protein). Following ER store depletion STIM1 and ORAI1 are&nbsp;assembled and co-clustered, which lead to the opening of CRAC channels in the plasma membrane and<br />let calcium enter in to the cell. As the calcium enters, its target is immediately and selectively activated.&nbsp;This mechanism explains how different ways of increasing calcium activate different cellular responses.&nbsp;This issue is nicely encapsulated by the nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT) family of Ca2+&nbsp;dependent transcription factors, which are essential for vertebrate development, differentiation and immune function. NFAT proteins share the same spatial and temporal domain and are activated by the&nbsp;same intracellular signal. I will discuss how NFAT isoforms (NFAT1 and NFAT4) that co-exist within&nbsp;the same sub-cellular domain are differentially activated by CRAC channels. Our research demonstrates&nbsp;that NFAT1 has a private line of communication with plasma membrane calcium channels, activating in&nbsp;response to Ca2+ microdomains near the open channels. By contrast NFAT4 is more of a co-incidence&nbsp;detector, requiring both local Ca2+ entry through the same channels as well as a rise in nuclear Ca2+. I&nbsp;would also like to discuss the down stream regulation of NFAT-driven gene expression. Impaired&nbsp;NFAT activation due to aberrant CRAC channel function in immune cell causes severe combined&nbsp;immunodeficiency syndrome (SCID). Therefore, targeting the CRAC channel may provide a promising&nbsp;therapeutic approach to control the severity of an immune response.</p> <br> Talk by Prof Siddhartha  Gadgil on 'Automating Mathematics' </br><br><p>I will discuss various stuff related to the goal of having computers play a central role in the discovery of mathematical proofs, including some of my own efforts.</p> <br> Mathematical Immunology </br><br><p>TBA</p> <br> Polymers for the control and manipulation of cells </br><br><p>In my talk I will introduce polymer microarray technology; including our inkjet mediated fabrication methodologies (which allows over 7000 different substrates to be made on a single glass slide) and describe how this approach has been used in a large number of stem cell based applications, notably:</p>

The use of polymer microarray technology to discover a novel thermo-responsive chemically-defined hydrogel for long term culture of human embryonic stem cells, while deciphering its mode of operation) (Nature Communication, 2013).

<p>Serotonin is more popularly known as a neurotransmitter although more than 90% of it in the body is found outside the central nervous system where it is attributed with several functions such as modulation of gut motility, cardiac function and platelet aggregation. Serotonin is also known to have a role during development such as patterning of left-right asymmetry, embryogenesis among others. The presence of serotonin in mouse embryonic stem cells has also been shown however its role in embryonic stem cells has not been reported so far.</p>
<p>In my work, I have shown that serotonin is present in both mouse and human embryonic stem (ES) cells and is partially localized to the mitochondria. In both mouse and human embryonic stem cells, exogenous serotonin decreases reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, presumably by acting as a ROS scavenger. In human ES cells, this serotonin mediated decrease in ROS levels is partly via the serotonin transporter. Next, I have shown that exogenous serotonin increased mitochondrial potential in mouse ES cells but not in human ES cells. Interestingly, when human ES cells which are known to be in the &lsquo;primed&rsquo; state, were converted to mouse ES-like cells, i.e. the &lsquo;na&iuml;ve&rsquo; state, they became responsive to serotonin mediated increase in mitochondrial potential. In other words, there is a na&iuml;ve state specific modulation of mitochondrial potential by serotonin in ES cells.</p>
<p>Further, I have shown that in the mouse ES cells, the serotonin mediated increase in mitochondrial potential is mediated via complex I of electron transport chain (ETC). Using a hemizygous Htr2a+/- mouse ES cell line, I have also shown that, the serotonin 2A receptor is important for the serotonin mediated increase in mitochondrial potential. However, when I used the most commonly used ligands of the serotonin 2A receptor, these results were not consistent suggesting that pharmacological agents modulate several pathways in cells and hence need to be used with caution.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that mice, in which tryptophan hydroxylase (Tph 1 &amp; 2), the enzymes known to synthesize serotonin have been knocked out, are viable and fertile although low levels are still present. These results suggest that either endogenous serotonin is dispensable or that other molecules and/or low levels of serotonin can compensate. To address this, I generated mouse induced pluripotent stem cells from fibroblasts which have been derived from Tph 1, 2 and the serotonin transporter (Slc6) knockout strains. These cells are being characterized to provide model systems to control the serotonin levels and delineate the pathway/s involved in mediating the effects of serotonin on ES cells.</p>
<p><strong>Culture media and human pluripotent stem cells</strong></p>
<p>In the process of determining the effects of serotonin as an anti-oxidant, it became clear that the levels of ROS in human pluripotent stem cells (HPSCs) are highly variable in the different media routinely used. ROS at high levels is known to damage DNA, RNA, lipids and protein and is harmful to cells and would affect their genetic stability. Genetic stability is vital for HPSCs, both for use in regenerative medicine as well as models for a variety of human diseases.</p>
<p>HPSCs are known to have mechanisms that ensure their genomic integrity but my study shows that they are not sufficient to override the changes brought about by different media.</p>
<p>Specifically, I have shown that mTeSR and Essential 8 (E8) media which are widely used for HPSC culture, have adverse effects on HPSCs when compared to the classically used human ES media containing knockout serum replacement (KSR). mTeSR and E8 media increase mitochondrial potential and ROS levels in HPSCs. The high ROS levels are associated with higher levels of nuclei acid damage in HPSCs in E8 and mTeSR as listed below:</p>
<p>- 8-hydroxyguanosine levels,</p>
<p>- Double stranded breaks</p>
<p>- Sensitivity to &gamma;-irradiation</p>
<p>- Aberrant mitotis</p>
<p>- Single nucleotide variations and copy number variations</p>
<p>I have shown that addition of antioxidants to E8 and mTeSR media partially ameliorates these effects confirming that oxidative stress indeed contributes to the adverse effects of these media.</p>
<p>With these results, we posit that monitoring mitochondrial potential and ROS levels in HPSCs are crucial in addition to the routinely tested parameters, to assess and maintain the &lsquo;quality&rsquo; of HPSCs.</p>
<p>In addition, I have determined that the shape and number of nucleoli in HPSCs can serve as genotoxic &lsquo;stress-sensors&rsquo;. HPSCs cultured in E8 and mTeSR showed rounded and reduced number of nucleoli when compared to reticulate and multiple nucleoli in KSR. Further, when HPSCs in KSR media were subjected to external DNA damaging stimuli, the nucleoli morphology changed dramatically and resembled that in E8 and mTeSR which I have shown are under high oxidative stress. Thus, nucleoli can act as a sensitive indicator in reflecting genotoxic stress in HPSCs.</p>
<p>In summary, my work shows that it is imperative that mitochondrial potential and ROS levels be monitored in the choice of culture media for HPSCs and that nucleoli morphology can act as a simple litmus test in routine culture of HPSCs to assess their &lsquo;stress&rsquo; levels.&nbsp;</p>

Acute stress&nbsp;has been shown to trigger a delayed increase in the density of dendritic spines in the<br />basolateral amygdala (BLA) of rodents. However, the physiological correlates of this&nbsp;delayed spinogenesis in the BLA remain unexplored. Further, NMDA receptors&nbsp;(NMDARs) have been known to underlie chronic stress-induced structural plasticity&nbsp;in the hippocampus, but nothing is known about the role of these receptors in the&nbsp;delayed spinogenesis, and its physiological consequences, in the BLA following acute&nbsp;stress. Another candidate molecular pathway, the endocannabinoid (eCB) system, is&nbsp;currently being explored extensively because of the anxiolytic and stress-reducing&nbsp;effects of cannabis in humans. eCBs, anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol&nbsp;(2-AG), are postsynaptically synthesized molecules that act as retrograde messengers&nbsp;and bind to presynaptically localized CB1 receptors, the same receptors that bind to&nbsp;the psychoactive constituent of cannabis. The primary function of the eCB system is&nbsp;to gate and regulate neurotransmitter release, thus fine tuning the strength of a&nbsp;synapse. Accumulating evidence from animal models has shown that tissue content&nbsp;of AEA in the amygdala decreases with acute restraint stress and that inhibition of&nbsp;FAAH (enzyme involved in hydrolyzing AEA) leads to restoration of normal levels&nbsp;of AEA. However, nothing is known about the synaptic correlates of alterations in&nbsp;eCB levels or the effects of pharmacological modulation of the eCB system on BLA&nbsp;function in response to stress.&nbsp;In light of the issues discussed above, my studies focused primarily on exploring two&nbsp;specific questions. First, we investigated the physiological correlates of the delayed&nbsp;formation of new dendritic spines in the BLA ten days after a single episode of 2-hour&nbsp;immobilization stress. Second, we studied the molecular mechanisms activated in the&nbsp;BLA during acute stress and their role in the eventual spinogenesis, and its&nbsp;physiological consequences, ten days later.&nbsp;Using whole-cell recordings in rat brain slices, we find that a single exposure to 2-hour immobilization stress enhances the frequency, but not amplitude; of miniature&nbsp;excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) recorded from principal neurons in the&nbsp;BLA 10 days later. This was also accompanied by faster use-dependent block of NMDA receptor currents during repeated stimulation of thalamic inputs to the BLA,&nbsp;which is indicative of higher presynaptic release probability at these inputs 10 days&nbsp;later. Further, targeted in vivo infusion of the NMDAR-antagonist APV into the BLA&nbsp;during the acute stress prevents the increase in mEPSC frequency and spine density&nbsp;10 days later. Together, these results identify a role for NMDARs during acute stress&nbsp;in both the physiological and morphological strengthening of synaptic connectivity in&nbsp;the BLA in a delayed fashion.&nbsp;We show that acute immobilization stress leads to a decrease in AEA levels and&nbsp;causes an increase in 2-AG. We see an increase in basal excitatory synaptic&nbsp;transmission after pharmacological blockade of CB1Rs and stress, which suggests&nbsp;that under steady state, AEA signaling within the BLA restrains glutamatergic&nbsp;signaling. On the other hand, stress-induced decrease in inhibition correlated with&nbsp;increased 2-AG levels. This could explain low spontaneous activity in the amygdala&nbsp;in the basal state, which then tilts towards enhanced excitation under conditions of&nbsp;stress. We also show that blocking FAAH prevents acute stress-induced immediate&nbsp;and delayed increase in mEPSC frequency and increased spine numbers in the BLA&nbsp;10 days after stress. Remarkably, FAAH inhibition does not have any effect on stressinduced&nbsp;reduction in mIPSC frequency or increase in 2-AG, confirming that AEA&nbsp;exclusively regulates excitatory release in the BLA. Taken together, these data&nbsp;provide a novel perspective on how stress may influence amygdala hyperactivity&nbsp;through regulation of AEA and that the development of long-term changes in BLA&nbsp;physiology from stress exposure seems to require acute increase in excitatory drive&nbsp;during stress. These data open the door for the potential utility of FAAH inhibitors to&nbsp;treat anxiety and stress disorders&nbsp;</p> <br> Nutrient addition and lack of grazing reduce establishment of leguminous savanna tree seedlings </br><br><p><strong></strong>Competition between trees and grasses, particularly during the seedling stage, is a critical determinant of the establishment success of savanna trees and can thus regulate tree-grass ratios and savanna structure. Tree-grass competition is influenced by both nutrient availability and grazing, but the extent to which the strength of tree-grass competition changes across resource and grazing gradients remains unclear. In this study, I used a greenhouse experiment to evaluate how increases in nitrogen availability and simulated grazing of grasses influenced the growth and survival of three leguminous tree species characteristic of arid and semi-arid savannas in India. Increased nutrient availability reduced tree seedling growth and survival even in the absence of grass competition, potentially a consequence of nutrient toxicity. Grass competition reduced belowground biomass of tree seedlings, but not aboveground and total biomass. Interestingly, the strength of tree-grass competition did not appear to be influenced by nutrient availability in this experiment. Simulated grazing of grasses enhanced the growth of tree seedlings under conditions of low nutrient availability, but not when nutrient availability was high. These results suggest that the observed patterns of decreased tree cover and recruitment in nutrient-rich savannas can arise as a result of the direct toxic effects of increased nutrient availability on tree seedling establishment and growth rather than via the greater preemption of resources by grasses in more nutrient-rich sites.</p> <br> Brain tumor detection through CEST-MRI </br><br><p>Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) of biological systems has&nbsp;been used to study chemistry and physiology in situ because of its ability&nbsp;to detect multiple metabolites. Nevertheless, the inroad of MRS into&nbsp;clinical procedures have been hard because of low sensitivity in looking&nbsp;at the endogenous millimolar concentrations of metabolites compared to the&nbsp;molar signal strength of water-based MRI. Very recently, it was shown that<br />these low concentrations of metabolites of protons exchanging with water&nbsp;can be detected via the water signal by RF&nbsp;labeling of these protons and subsequent transfer of this label to water&nbsp;protons. This process, leading to saturation of the water signal and&nbsp;enhancement of the effect through repeated exchange, can be used for the<br />imaging of metabolite signals or exchangeable-proton- based contrast&nbsp;agents with enhanced sensitivity. This has given rise to the field of&nbsp;chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI, which has greatly&nbsp;increased the potential for translating spectroscopic methods to the&nbsp;clinic.</p>
<p>Recently, D-glucose has shown potential as a biodegradable contrast agent&nbsp;that can be detected using CEST MRI (glucoCEST), T1-based or T2-based&nbsp;relaxation approaches. Glucose derivatives detectable by CEST have also&nbsp;been suggested. To gain information regarding the&nbsp;time-dependent uptake of glucose and hence the tissue perfusion&nbsp;properties, time resolved dynamic images are required and the lab at&nbsp;Hopkins have previously demonstrated the development of dynamic glucose&nbsp;enhanced (DGE) imaging using CEST MRI at 7T. In this talk, I would discuss&nbsp;the translation of the technique to 3T clinical scanners for brain tumour&nbsp;patients showing the feasibility of glucose enhanced&nbsp;imaging at clinical field strength.</p> <br> Role of Cytoplasmic Poly A   Binding Protein (Smed-PABPC2) and alternate Polyadenylation in Schmidtea mediterranea regeneration and homeostasis. </br><br><p>Multicellular organisms have the ability to respond to injury and subsequently restore missing tissues or structures, including re-integration with the older, pre-existing tissue. This is accomplished through the action of stem and progenitor cells. Thus, identifying key cellular events that facilitate stem cell function and tissue organization is critical for understanding the process of regeneration.</p>
<p>Several model organisms are used to study about the stem cells and regeneration. However, planarians are the model organism of choice due to their immense regenerative ability. It can grow back to a complete animal from a 279th of its piece because of the presence of adult pluripotent stem cells known as neoblasts (Reddien and Sanchez Alvarado 2004).</p>
<p>In planaria, several factors responsible for stem cell properties such as proliferation, maintenance and differentiation have been identified with their corresponding orthologs in other species. Intensive research within the last several years has shown the broad roles of posttranscriptional processes in stem cell maintenance and differentiation including regulation via regulatory small RNAs and RBPs (Rouhana et al. 2010, Palakodeti et al. 2012, Sasidharan et al. 2013). These are involved either in stem cell renewal and/or differentiation, however the mechanism is unknown.</p>
<p>In this study, using planaria, we show that the initial events of regeneration, such as epithelialization and epidermal organization are critically regulated by a novel cytoplasmic Poly A binding protein, SMED-PABPC2. Knockdown (KD) of Smed-pabpc2 leads to defects in epidermal lineage specification, disorganization of epidermis and ECM, and deregulated wound healing resulting in the selective failure of neoblast proliferation near the wound region. Polysome profiling suggested epidermal lineage transcripts, including zfp-1, to be translationally regulated by SMED-PABPC2. Together, our results uncover a novel role of SMED-PABPC2 in the maintenance of epidermal and ECM integrity, critical for wound healing, and subsequent processes for regeneration. Overall, this study unfolds the interesting fact that the global translation regulator PABPC is not so global and has very specific role absolutely essential for planarian regeneration. It also reveals the importance of epidermis in planarian regeneration, which has long been speculated given its role in wound healing but has not been directly proven.</p>
<p>Another study from the lab deciphered extensive role of miRNAs in planarian regeneration. However, the bottleneck in the study was to identify the targets as no available transcriptome data had completely annotated 3&rsquo;UTRs. I, alongwith Vairavan (Bioinformatician), annotated the planarian transcriptome with complete 3&rsquo;UTRs. We performed poly A position profiling and sequencing (3P-Seq) to capture all poly A sites across the Schmidtea mediterranea genome. We identified the 3'UTRs for ~14,000 transcripts and thus improved the existing gene annotations (Lakshmanan and Bansal et al., 2016). This study helped to identify miRNA targets. Apart from that, we also identified alternatively polyadenylated (ApA) transcripts, either with an altered 3'UTR or a change in coding sequence. We also validated tissue-specific expression of some of the ApA transcripts.</p> <br> Understanding the role of 5-HT2A in the behavioural and biochemical effects of antipsychotics. </br><br><p>Antipsychotic drugs are on the forefront of the battle against mental illness such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and severe depression (Leucht et al., 2009; Lieberman et al., 2005; Ross et al., 2006).&nbsp; Although antipsychotics are largely successful at managing the symptoms of the mental illness they are often associated with side effects such sedation, extrapyramidal motor symptoms, increased risk of metabolic disorder etc. (Leucht et al., 2009; Nasrallah, 2008). Therefore there is continual quest for better and safer therapy, for which the mechanism of action of the existing antipsychotics should be thoroughly understood.</p>
<p>The discovery of antipsychotic drugs has been mainly accidental (Hippius, 1989). Binding studies have identified 5-HT2A and D2 as some of the primary targets of antipsychotics, among many other GPCRs (Roth et al., 2004). We have chosen to study the role of 5-HT2A receptor in the action of antipsychotics.</p>
<p>Levels of 5-HT2A are upregulated in the post-mortem cortical samples of schizophrenic patients. Chronic antipsychotic treatment reduces levels of 5-HT2A protein in patients as well as in animal models (Gonz&aacute;lez-Maeso et al., 2008; Muguruza et al., 2013). Moreover some naturally occurring variants (H452Y) of 5-HT2A are associated with antipsychotic resistance in schizophrenic patients (Williams et al., 1996). Collectively this data makes a strong point for the role of 5-HT2A in the therapeutic effects of antipsychotics. Interestingly 5-HT2A is also thought to be responsible for some of the antipsychotic induced side effects such as sedation and hyperglycaemia. Serotonergic system is implicated in sleep (Alenina et al., 2009). Moreover 5-HT2A antagonists have been shown to cause sedation in mice models (Williams et al., 2012). 5-HT2A has been also shown to regulate glucose metabolism (Hajduch et al., 1999; Yamada et al., 1997).</p>
<p>Therefore I have investigated the role of 5-HT2A in some of the behavioural or biochemical effects of antipsychotics using a 5-HT2A knockout mouse. This mouse was generated in-house in collaboration with Prof. Rupasri Ain. I observed that the 5-HT2A knockout mice were protected against the antipsychotic induced sedation. Interestingly I also observed that the presence of stimulants such as novel context, novel objects or a drug like caffeine could antagonize antipsychotic induced sedation, and more so in the 5-HT2A knockout mice, probably suggesting a non-pharmacological way to manage the side effect.</p>
<p>Furthermore to gain deeper insights into the role of 5-HT2A in the cellular effects of antipsychotics, I have studied the pattern of activity induced by antipsychotics in the mouse brain. I have used a c-Fos reporter system. c-Fos is a well characterized &nbsp;marker of neuronal activity. I have identified certain brain regions which get activated with specific antipsychotics. Moreover I have identified ependymal cells as a novel cellular target of the antipsychotic Clozapine. Importantly c-fos activity in ependymal cells seems 5-HT2A dependant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br> The anatomy of an adapted enzyme </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Although we have a good understanding of adaptation at the organismal level, there is paucity of data addressing how organisms adapt at the molecular level. We ask how enzymes evolve: what is evolution trying to optimise? Our study builds on Lenski&rsquo;s bacterial evolution experiment, in which twelve bacterial populations have evolved in a glucose-limited environment for over 60,000 generations. In each population, the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase has substitutions that have fixed: thus, we have captured an enzyme evolving&mdash;not once, but twelve times! Why is pykF a focal point for adaptation?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />To examine whether the evolved pykF alleles confer a fitness benefit in and of themselves, we replaced the wild-type pykF gene in the ancestor with each of the evolved pykF genes. Competitive fitness assays (against the ancestor) demonstrate that each of the pykF genes confer a fitness benefit. Metabolomic data demonstrate that the mutations cause fundamental changes in flux through glycolysis and the TCA cycle. Strikingly, seven of the eight evolved enzymes have the evolved altered allosteric regulation, yet the crystal structures and small angle X-ray scattering profiles for the evolved enzymes are surprisingly similar to each other and the wild-type, despite the variability in fitness and function. We turned to hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments to assess whether the evolved enzymes have altered dynamics and found that they are dynamically very different.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />Our results point to protein dynamics as an important mode for adaptive evolution in proteins: in this case, evolution seems to be acting on protein dynamics to alter enzyme allosteric function and optimise energy<br />metabolism in the low glucose environment.</p> <br> TBD </br><br><p>TBD</p> <br> Dark Energy and the Emerging Landscape of the Multiverse </br><br><p>TBA</p> <br> Stop-and-Go on metabolic highways or How C. elegans dauer larva survives desiccation. </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Some organisms can enter a so called cryptobiotic state. (Cryptobiosis means&nbsp;hidden/latent/secret life). This state is induced when organism is&nbsp;depleted of one of major factors that is essential for the life (e.g.&nbsp;water or oxygen) or at very high or low temperatures. During&nbsp;cryptobiosis, metabolism either is practically not detectable or is&nbsp;diminished to very low levels. Thus, nature has mechanisms to stop or&nbsp;decrease metabolism in a controlled manner and to restart it without&nbsp;damaging the organism. We have shown that C. elegans dauer larva is a true&nbsp;cryptobiont: It can survive full desiccation. Using as an advantage the&nbsp;fact that genetics and biochemistry of the worm are very advanced, we are&nbsp;able to investigate molecular mechanisms of cryptobiosis. In the last&nbsp;years, we delineated several novel pathways that are required for&nbsp;metabolic transition or preservation of the structure during a desiccated&nbsp;state.</p> <br> Molecular mechanisms governing ensemble behaviour of myosin II motors under unloaded conditions </br><br><p>Myosin II is a low duty ensemble motor that carries out vital physiological functions such as muscle contraction. In vivo, an ensemble of myosin molecules functions asynchronously to generate muscle contraction or tension development.

<p>In this work, we present the first detailed analysis of processive sliding and breakage of actin filaments at various heavy meromyosin (HMM) densities <g class="gr_ gr_37 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="37" data-gr-id="37">andATP</g> concentrations in IVMA. We observed that with <g class="gr_ gr_39 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="39" data-gr-id="39">addition</g> of ATP solution, the actin filaments fragmented stochastically; we then <g class="gr_ gr_40 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="40" data-gr-id="40">determined</g> mean length and velocity of surviving actin filaments post breakage.Using density of HMM molecules and length of <g class="gr_ gr_38 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del" id="38" data-gr-id="38">actin</g>, we estimated the number of HMM molecules per actin filament (N) that participate in processive sliding of actin.</p>
<p>Only those filaments that were able to interact with a minimum number of HMM molecules (N) could sustain processive sliding. N was observed to be only a function of ATP concentration. At 2 mM ATP, 88&plusmn;24 molecules and at 0.1 mM ATP, 54&plusmn;22 molecules are required for continuous sliding of actin in IVMA. Processive sliding of actin filament was observed when N lay within the above range at each ATP concentration. These estimates helped arrive at a minimum lower limit (Nmin) and a maximum upper limit (Nmax) to the number of HMM molecules that can interact with a smooth sliding actin filament in IVMA under our experimental conditions. When N&lt;Nmin, the actin filament diffused away from the surface and processivity was lost, probably because at least one tightly bound myosin molecule is required to anchor the actin filament to the surface. When N &gt;Nmax, the filament underwent breakage eventually and could not sustain processive sliding. We postulate this maximum upper limit arises due to increased number of strongly bound myosin heads.</p>
<p>We also widened our perspectives to the understanding of sliding of regulated native thin filaments (NTF). Unlike unregulated actin, we observed no <g class="gr_ gr_35 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del" id="35" data-gr-id="35">actin</g> breakage of <g class="gr_ gr_36 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="36" data-gr-id="36">NTFs</g> irrespective of any experimental condition.</p>
<p>Based on our experimental findings, we concluded that duty ratio of myosin II remains constant irrespective of changes in myosin density and ATP concentration.We have thus also determined for the first time the number of simultaneously attached myosin molecules (Na) to be ~1-2 at a given time despite changes in the experimental environment.We further deduced that the unloaded shortening velocity of the actin filaments is a function of ATP only and is independent of <g class="gr_ gr_34 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="34" data-gr-id="34">pCa</g> and myosin density.</p>
<p>We believe these inferences from our experimental data will greatly aid in reaching a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying myosin motility in an ensemble. The results may also prove useful in the design of novel molecular motility-based devices in nanotechnology.</p> <br> Osmotic instabilities and organelle biogenesis </br><br><p>We study a membrane tube with unidirectional ion pumps driving an osmotic pressure difference. A pressure driven peristaltic instability is identified, quantitatively distinct from similar tension-driven Rayleigh type instabilities on membrane tubes. We discuss how this instability could be related to the function and biogenesis of membrane bound organelles, in particular the contractile vacuole complex. The unusually long natural wavelength of this instability is in close agreement with that observed in cells.</p>
<p></p> <br> Metabolic Regulations by Genome Integrity Surveillance Checkpoints </br><br><p>Genome maintenance and adequate regulation of metabolic <br />pathways to the cellular environment are conserved key determinants of healthy aging. The DNA damage response (DDR) checkpoint preserves genome integrity by orchestrating cell cycle progression, DNA repair and survival. Direct regulations of metabolic pathways by DDR checkpoint kinases and metabolic adaptations in DDR-deficient animal models suggest an intricate connection between DDR and metabolic pathways, but we are lacking a comprehensive view of metabolic regulations by the DDR checkpoint under physiological conditions. To dissect such regulations, we combined metabolomics and chemogenomic screenings in budding yeast checkpoint kinase mutants. We identified severe metabolic alterations in a small subset of these mutants, overall reflecting a glucose starvation-like status. Consistently, affected checkpoint mutants were <br />hypersensitive to glucose deprivation. Synthetic genetic array (SGA) <br />screening, using /rad53/&Delta;(yeast homolog of CHK1/CHK2) mutants as model, identified potential checkpoint targets supporting checkpoint-regulated chromatin-metabolism interplay. Together, our results reveal previously unrecognized metabolic regulations by the DDR checkpoint.</p> <br> Targeting â€œPersistersâ€: A new paradigm for tuberculosis drug development </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), a&nbsp;disease that kills 2 million people every year worldwide. It is estimated that one third&nbsp;of the world&rsquo;s population is infected with Mtb, with the majority (90%) suffering&nbsp;from an asymptomatic latent form of this disease. Approximately ten per cent of these&nbsp;latently infected carriers develop active TB later in their life triggering a vicious&nbsp;cycle, generating more new cases every year. Most pathogens would be killed and&nbsp;cleared by the macrophages. However, Mtb is able to replicate and survive inside&nbsp;these macrophages for decades due of the generation of a non-replicative,&nbsp;metabolically inactive subset of the Mtb population called &ldquo;persisters&rdquo;. These slow&nbsp;growing persisters become less responsive to drugs and require long treatment&nbsp;regimens for their clearance. The development of new and effective antimycobacterial&nbsp;drugs hinges on our ability to target this subset of the Mtb population inside the host.&nbsp;Mtb's metabolic adaptations are central to the maintenance of these persisters and&nbsp;prevailing evidence has strongly implicated host-derived fatty acids and cholesterol as&nbsp;carbon sources for growth and persistence during infection. Our lab is currently&nbsp;interested in identifying Mtb pathways and networks critical for generating persisters.&nbsp;The information and knowledge thus generated would create opportunity to target&nbsp;persisters and help shorten the treatment regimen. This would require analyzing both,&nbsp;the changes in the signaling networks responsible for the survival adaptability of the&nbsp;pathogen inside the host and the effects of pathogen-mediated perturbations on critical&nbsp;host signaling networks.</p> <br> ROOT ARCHITECTURE AND FLUID TRANSPORT MECHANISMS IN RICE (Oryza sativa L.) UNDER DROUGHT AND SALT </br><br><p>Drought and salinity adversely affect production of rice (<em>Oryza sativa</em> L.) - an important food crop for one-third of world&rsquo;s population. This study examined the physiological responses across rice cultivars with varying sensitivity to salt and drought to investigate how specialists in one regime would fare when faced with an orthogonal stress. Four rice cultivars examined for this purpose were &ndash; the salt tolerant Pokkali, the drought tolerant ARB6 and two sensitive varieties Jaya and IR-20. Soil grown one month old plants were subjected to well-watered, drought (no irrigation) and salinity (150mM NaCl) stress for a week. Further, to address whether morphological and physiological responses are systemic, a split root system was used, where the plant roots were divided into two and each half treated independently to either symmetric or asymmetric water, salt or drought condition.<br />When exposed to drought and salinity stress, surprisingly, the salt tolerant Pokkali did reasonably well when subjected to drought as did the drought tolerant ARB6 under saline stress - in contrast to the stress-sensitive varieties IR-20 and Jaya. ARB6 enhanced fluid uptake to a great extent followed by Pokkali, Jaya and IR-20 under drought stress whereas, Pokkali restricted fluid entry to limit Na+ uptake followed by ARB6 under saline stress while Jaya and IR-20 exhibited less restriction. Both tolerant varieties used long roots to mine water under deficit conditions while increasing aerenchyma development to enhance oxygen supply to deep-reaching roots. Water uptake was also observed to be driven by osmolyte accumulation under deficit conditions.</p>
<p><br />Major alterations in the patterns of suberization in both exodermis and endodermis were observed using fluorescence microscopy and were dramatically different under the two stresses. Our results indicate that under saline stress, apoplastic suberization in Pokkali was more extensive of the four cultivars which also reflected in low shoot Na+ levels. In Pokkali extensive suberization helps restricting fluid flow to symplastic routes minimizing Na+ entry while this mechanism is deployed to a lesser extent by other three varieties.</p>
<p>Under drought stress, suberization in ARB6 had dramatically reduced while the number of passage cells had increased than the other three varieties ensuring more fluid uptake. The expression profiles of suberin biosynthetic genes had also gone up under saline stress but showed low expression under drought stress.<br />After exposing the plants to either symmetric or asymmetric water, drought or saline condition for a week in split root experiment, in addition to morphology the physiological responses such as abscisic acid (ABA) synthesis and stomatal conductance were also estimated. When subjected to asymmetric conditions, the roots of the tolerant varieties underwent major anatomical and physiological modifications on the stressed side which in turn ensured fluid uptake and maintenance of xylem sap flow, while, the sensitive varieties appeared to derive much of their fluid and nutrition from the watered side. The data also indicated a dramatic increase in ABA concentrations in the xylem sap after Day 1 in all four cultivars in response to either drought or salinity stress on at least one side the of the split root system.</p>
<p><br />Overall, the morphological and physiological responses of the tolerant varieties ensure adequate fluid flow through the transpiration stream without excessive salt uptake, thereby promoting growth under both drought and salinity.</p> <br> Phosphoinositide kinases and PI(4,5)P2 turnover in Drosophila photoreceptors </br><br><p>Phosphoinositides have a crucial role in many cellular processes. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] is an important multifunctional phosphoinositide lipid that controls several essential cellular functions including generation of second messengers, cytoskeletal rearrangements, vesicle transport and control of ion channel activity (Di Paolo &amp; De Camilli, 2006). Some of these functions require its hydrolysis by PLC, whereas others, such as membrane transport and cytoskeletal function, involve the interaction of the intact lipid with cellular proteins. The mechanistic basis underlying the segregation of these two classes of PI(4,5)P2 dependent functions is unknown. The photoreceptors of the fruit fly, <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>, represent an important genetic model for G-protein coupled hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2. Once hydrolyzed by PLC, the PI(4,5)P2 level in photoreceptor cells is replenished by a metabolic cycle known as the PI cycle. The last step in PI cycle is mediated by a class of enzyme called phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases (PIPKs). <em>Drosophila</em> provides a unique opportunity to apply molecular genetic analysis to study the diverse functions of different PIPKs in a single cell type. In this thesis, I have used Drosophila photoreceptor cells to study the role of PIPKs in maintenance of distinct functional PI(4,5)P2 pools in vivo.</p>
<p>There are contradictory reports on the existence of PI(4,5)P2 pools in different systems. It has been shown that in INS1 cells&nbsp; (Ji, Zhang, &amp; Lou, 2015), PI(4,5)P2 is mostly homogeneously distributed in the plasma membrane. Contradictory to this study, Fujita et al.(Fujita, &amp; Fujimoto, 2009) has shown that PI(4,5)P2 is highly enriched in specific places in the PM. It was shown that, angiotensin induced reduction in PI(4,5)P2 level caused differential depletion rate at different domains of the PM, suggesting the existence of distinct PI(4,5)P2 pools in cultured fibroblasts. Most of these studies are done in cultured cells and the in vivo evidence of the existence of functional PI(4,5)P2 pools is lacking and the work done in this thesis addresses this issue in a systematic way.</p>
<p>In silico analysis of <em>Drosophila</em> genome suggested the existence of multiple PIPKs (dPIP5K, sktl, dPIP4K). The role of all those three kinases was checked in photoreceptors using loss-of-function mutants. The major phenotype of dPIP5K mutant (dPIP5K18) was reduced sensitivity to light as evident from electroretinogram (ERG) recordings. In vivo PI(4,5)P2 imaging using PI(4,5)P2 biosensor showed delay in&nbsp; PI(4,5)P2 recovery in dPIP5K18, strongly suggesting the role of dPIP5K in contributing the PI(4,5)P2 pool that support phototransduction (Chakrabarti P, Kolay S 2015). Experiments were performed to check if knock out of dPIP5K affect all PI(4,5)P2 dependent cellular processes in photoreceptor cells. Interestingly, the results from these experiments indicate that loss of dPIP5K affects only the PLC dependent signaling process but does not affect the non-PLC dependent functions of PIP2, such as vesicular transport and the actin cytoskeleton. In comparison, knockout (KO) of dPIP4K did not show any ERG defect indicating that dPIP4K is not involved in phototransduction signaling. Neither, does it seem to be the kinase needed for the PI(4,5)P2 production for maintaining the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton. Making a KO of the other PIP5K, sktl&nbsp; was not possible because sktl KO was found to be cell lethal, suggesting that&nbsp; sktl might be involved in providing the PI(4,5)P2 pool to support the cellular housekeeping functions like to maintain actin cytoskeleton and cellular endocytosis.</p>
<p>These findings support the existence of distinct functional pools of PI(4,5)P2 synthesized by distinct PIPK enzymes in <em>Drosophila </em>photoreceptors. However, the mechanism by which different pools of PI(4,5)P2 in a single membrane are kept separate from mixing is not clear. In addition to differentially localized and regulated PIPK isoforms, mechanisms for maintenance of distinct PI(4,5)P2 pools are equally important (Kolay, Basu, &amp; Raghu, 2016). The filament forming property of septins (group of GTP binding proteins) and their affinity to bind different phospholipids, make these proteins potentially important in the context of compartmentalized PI(4,5)P2 pools within the plasma membrane. Therefore, the role of septins in Drosophila phototransduction process was investigated. We identified pnut (one of the Drosophila septins) as an important regulator of the phototransduction process through an initial RNAi screen. The role of pnut in regulation of PI(4,5)P2 turnover and phototransduction process was further investigated. Knock down of pnut showed an increase in light sensitivity as evident from ERG recordings, indicating that pnut controls light response in adult photoreceptors. It was also found that knock down of pnut increased the rate of PI(4,5)P2 turnover in photoreceptor cells without affecting the PI(4,5)P2 synthesis. These results collectively suggest for its potential role in lipid turnover.</p>

<p></p> <br> Nanoclusters of integrins underlie cell matrix adhesions </br><br><p>Integrin adhesions assemble and mature in response to ligand binding and mechanical factors, but the molecular-level organization has not been known. We find that &sim;100-nm clusters of &sim;50 &beta;3-activated integrins form very early adhesions under a wide variety of conditions on RGD surfaces.<br />These adhesions form similarly on fluid and rigid substrates, but most adhesions are transient on rigid substrates. Without talin or actin polymerization, few early adhesions form, and expression of either the talin head or rod domain in talin-depleted cells restores early adhesion formation. Mutation of the integrin binding site in the talin rod decreases cluster size. We suggest that the integrin clusters constitute universal early adhesions and that they are the modular units of cell matrix adhesions. They form in the presence of blebbistatin suggesting that they are formed prior to force sensing. They require the association of activated integrins with cytoplasmic proteins, in particular talin and actin, and cytoskeletal contraction on them causes adhesion maturation for cell motility and growth. Using gold nano-patterning we observe that these clusters grow using unliganded but activated integrins. Ligand geometry determines cluster growth. This indicates that free interns assemble the clusters rapidly around an activated and liganded integrins. These early nascent adhesions have distinct behaviors on compliant and rigid substrates, since the epidermal growth factor receptor is recruited to these clusters only on the rigid substrates, in absence of EGF. EGFR acts as a mechanoenzyme that is required for mechanotransduction within fibroblasts. Taken together our studies show that nascent adhesions form on substrates of vastly varying rigidities.These modular clusters of integrins constitute the basis of cell matrix adhesions that control cell growth, differentiation and death. Many questions remain about how different ligands alter cluster behavior and how clusters behave in different cellular functions.</p>
<p></p> <br> Interrogations on cell cycle in a dimorphic bacterium </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">A growing body of evidence shows that both free-living and pathogenic bacteria coordinate different stages of their cell cycle, similar to eukaryotes. However, the underlying mechanisms that control cell cycle events in bacteria remain largely unknown. My group is interested in deciphering the mechanisms that regulate bacterial cell cycle, and cell fate determination, using the asymmetrically dividing bacterium, Caulobacter crescentus, as the model organism. In my talk, I will describe our recent studies that have lead to the discovery of (i) a highly conserved signaling mechanism that regulates cell-type specific molecular events during cellular differentiation in bacteria, and (ii) a dynamic cytoplasmic redox that oscillates during cell cycle to impinge on various cell cycle programs in Caulobacter. Finally, I will provide an overview of how our discovery of an oscillating cytoplasmic redox have opened up new avenues in the study of cell cycle progression and development in bacteria.</p> <br> Direct and indirect effects of nutrient deposition on woody vegetation dynamics of tropical dry forests. </br><br><p>Increasing rates of atmospheric nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) deposition are recognised as major drivers of global change. The enhanced availability of these essential plant nutrients can modify vegetation communities directly &ndash; through changes in plant productivity &ndash; and indirectly &ndash; by modifying disturbance regimes and the susceptibility of plants to disturbance events. Hence, assessing the long-term impacts of nutrient deposition on ecosystem trajectories need to account for both these direct and indirect effects. However, most research on this topic has thus far focussed on temperate ecosystem vegetation communities.</p>
<p>In this dissertation, I investigated how N and P deposition influences tree recruitment in tropical dry forests. The tree community comprises two co-dominant functional groups: N-fixers and non-N-fixers, which differ in their nutrient requirements and uptake strategies. Frequent fires, which are fuelled by a continuous grass layer, impose a strong control on tree recruitment, and hence, are a strong determinant of ecosystem structure, diversity and function. The study comprised three fertilisation experiments, viz., germination, pot and field experiments, and included multiple N-fixing and non-N-fixing tree species commonly found in tropical dry forests across India. My main objectives were to determine (i) how N and P deposition modifies tropical dry forest tree recruitment directly &ndash; through changes in germination and early seedling growth &ndash; and indirectly &ndash; by altering seedling susceptibility to and recovery from fire, and (ii) if N-fixing and non-N-fixing species showed differing responses to nutrient deposition at each of these stages.</p>
<p>In the germination experiment I demonstrated that nutrient deposition has a negative influence on tree seed germination. The effects were contingent on soil drainage properties, resulting in reduced germination in poorly-drained soils and delayed germination in well-drained soils. Importantly, N-fixers consistently showed stronger negative responses to N and P addition.</p>
<p>In the pot experiment, N-fixers were co-limited by N and P availability, while non-N-fixers were limited by N only. Both functional groups increased biomass when fertilised, but this came at the cost of lower relative below-ground investment that is critical for seedling survival from fire. Additionally, non-N-fixers also showed a reduction in root storage carbohydrate content when fertilised, suggesting a lower rate of post-fire recovery when fertilised.</p>
<p>In the field experiment, nutrient addition increased plant sizes amongst non-N-fixers and thus increased their survival probability from fire. This provides non-N-fixers with an advantage, as N-fixers showed virtually no fire mediated mortality, and hence, had no opportunity to improve survival when fertilised. Further, post-fire recovery was impeded by nutrient addition, especially in non-N-fixers. However, effect sizes were small and are only likely to influence recruitment when coupled with high fire frequencies.</p>
<p>In summary, differences in the the effects of nutrient deposition on N-fixers and non-N-fixers was a recurring theme in observations across my experiments. My results suggest that nutrient deposition could provide non-N-fixers with a relative advantage during tree recruitment, acting primarily through smaller negative effects during germination and increases in survival from fire. Hence, long-term shifts in dry forest tree functional composition favouring non-N-fixers can be expected.</p>
<p></p> <br> Characterization of the mechanism of aggregation by the prion protein </br><br><p>Prions are fatal pathogenic agents, which cause a group of neurodegenerative diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies or prion diseases. Conformational conversion of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) into a insoluble, misfolded, oligomeric, and protease-resistant form (PrPSc) is responsible for the pathogenesis and transmission of prion diseases. Despite the well-known role of the&nbsp; conformational conversion of PrPC in prion pathogenesis, the mechanism of this conversion, or the final structure of the misfolded PrPSc, remain unknown. Understanding the mechanism of prion protein misfolding and aggregation is therefore essential for designing therapeutics to prevent the prion diseases. Generally, prion diseases occur either spontaneously or due to transmission from diseased individuals. Nevertheless, a significant number of prion disease cases have been reported to be due to familial mutations in the Prnp gene that codes for the prion protein.</p>
<p>These disease-causing mutations are localized mainly in the middle hydrophobic core region (sequence segment 105-126) of the unstructured NTR, as wells as in helix 2 and helix 3 of the structured CTD. Several mutations found in the CTD affect the thermodynamic stability, and also increase the native state dynamics of the prion protein, which accelerates the misfolding of the prion protein. However, several disease-linked mutations, especially mutations in the unstructured NTR, do not affect the structure and stability of the proteins, but still accelerate the misfolding of the prion protein. The unstructured NTR of the prion protein is known to affect its misfolding and aggregation, but little is known about how it does this. Hence, understanding the mechanism by which mutations present in the unstructured NTR affect the misfolding and oligomerizationmight help in understanding the role of the unstructured NTR in prion diseases.</p>
<p>Mechanistic studies of the prion protein aggregation in vitro utilize recombinant prion protein, which provides a good model system for understanding the mechanism of conformational conversion. At low pH and in the presence of salt, the prion protein can misfold and form oligomers, and these oligomers associate and form worm-like fibrils. At physiological pH, prion protein can aggregate in the presence of chemical denaturants and form long straight amyloid fibrils. Importantly, these in vitro generated oligomers and fibrils have been shown to be cytotoxic, and the fibrils formed from recombinant prion protein are known to spread disease in healthy organisms. Despite the fact that these in vitro generated aggregates show features similar to those of in vivo generated prion aggregates, the molecular mechanisms of the oligomerization and amyloid fibril formation reactions of the prion protein are yet to be understood.</p>
<p>Structural and kinetic studies with wild type mouse prion protein (wt moPrP) indicated that the conformational conversion from -helical rich monomer to &beta;-sheet rich oligomers occurs at pH 4 in the presence of salt, and that the rate-limiting step in this process is dimer formation. During oligomerization at pH 4, the unfolding of helix 1 ( ) appeared to occur concurrently with the conformational conversion of helix 2 ( 2) and helix 3 ( 3) (Sabareesan and Udgaonkar, 2016). Studies of two pathogenic mutations present in the unstructured NTR of moPrP, G113V and A116V, showed that without affecting the native protein structure and stability, these two pathogenic mutations accelerated both misfolding and oligomerization. Importantly, sequence segment 89-132 from the NTR became structured during oligomerization, and this occurred prior to the structural changes in the CTD, where the observed structural changes were similar to those of wt moPrP (Sabareesan and Udgaonkar, 2016). wt moPrP binds to lipid membrane and forms well-defined low-conductance channels, which conducts K+ and Ca2+. The pathogenic mutation A116V enhanced the ion-channel activity of the prion protein (Sabareesan et al., 2016).</p>
<p>&nbsp;The aggregation mechanism of wt &nbsp;moPrP at pH 7 and 37 â—‹C, in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride, follows a nucleation dependent polymerization (NDP) model, with a monomeric nucleus, as determined by quantitative analysis of the kinetics of aggregation over a range of protein concentrations when monitored by ThT fluorescence (Sabareesan and Udgaonkar, in preparation). Studies of amyloid fibril formation by a mutant variant with a protective mutation present in the middle hydrophobic region, G126V, suggest that the protective mutation increases the lag time, increases the critical concentration, and slows down the nucleation dependent fibril formation of the prion protein (Sabareesan and Udgaonkar, in preparation). The middle hydrophobic region of the prion protein plays an important role in prion protein oligomerization and amyloid fibril formation (Sabareesan and Udgaonkar, 2016, Sabareesan and Udgaonkar, in preparation).</p> <br> Mimetic butterflies prefer light environments that correspond to visual sensitivities and microhabitat </br><br><p>Many questions remain on the efficacy, evolution, and function of signal mimicry. M&uuml;ller hypothesized unpalatable individuals converge on the same conspicuous coloration to reduce predation. However, there are cases of unpalatable species diverging from shared conspicuous signals. Environmental factors such as ambient light have been hypothesized to affect signal efficacy in animals. We tested three related hypotheses investigating effects of light environments on mimetic pairs of Heliconius butterflies: 1) different mimetic pairs are segregated by light environment; 2) mimetic individuals prefer light environments in which they naturally occur; and 3) mimetic individuals have visual systems matching lighting requirements of their habitat. Mimetic pairs were segregated by light environment and individuals were more likely to seek light environments that matched their respective habitat. Mimetic pairs differed in absolute visual sensitivities. Forest mimics preferred dim light and had greater visual sensitivity than open habitat mimics, which preferred bright light. The findings support different light environments leading to different behavioural and physiological adaptations.</p> <br> Scent and Sensibility </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Chemical sensing is the oldest evolutionary adaptation and is used by&nbsp;almost all motile species from bacteria to mammals. Bacteria and other&nbsp;simple organisms use chemical gradients to move toward a desired area&nbsp;(chemotaxis). Larger animals such as fruitflies trying to find some nice&nbsp;rotting fruit or dogs tracking a scent trail use olfactory (and other cues&nbsp;like wind direction) to locate the desired source. In this talk, I will&nbsp;present some&nbsp;recent work that we have been doing on chemotaxis and olfactory navigation.<br />In the first part of the talk, I describe some new experiments on bacterial&nbsp;chemotaxis that show novel behavior. We use the classic Keller-Segel&nbsp;equations and then a very simplified mean-field approach to explain this&nbsp;behavior. In the second part of the talk, I will discuss the problem of&nbsp;trail following and odor location by single organisms. I will start with a&nbsp;very simplistic model based on the assumption of a smooth gradient and show&nbsp;that even this problem leads to some very interesting mathematics. I then&nbsp;show some examples of the real world of odor distribution and why this is a<br />really hard problem.</p> <br> Using large-scale acoustic monitoring to tackle big conservation questions </br><br><p>Acoustic recordings have the potential to address a suite of important conservation questions, from assessing phenology shifts due to climate change, to examining the impact of anthropogenic noise on wildlife. Acoustic recorders can be placed across large spatial scales, collecting data in synchronized, permanent, and consistent way. I review a few examples from our team&rsquo;s ecological research where we use acoustic recordings to answer pressing conservation questions. First, we use 3 years of continuous acoustic recordings in Glacier Bay National Park, Alaska, an area experiencing rapid warming and glacial retreat, to examine songbird phenology. Long-term monitoring programs have reported earlier occurrence of spring activity, reflecting species response to climate change. We use a rapidly calculated acoustic algorithm, representing an index of bird community complexity, and determine that songbirds are arriving 5 days earlier in the spring. Second, we use bioacoustics to examine the effect of different fire treatments in a historically fire suppressed area, Sequoia Kings Canyon National Park. We place acoustic recorders in different fire treatment types and found that prescribed burning effectively increases avian biodiversity. Third, we use paired video and acoustic recordings to examine the impact of visitor noise on Brandt&rsquo;s cormorants Phalacrocorax penicillatus at Alcatraz Island, an important nesting site and one of California&rsquo;s most visited attractions. Although visitors were not visible from the cormorant colony, visitor noise levels inside a building adjacent to the colony affects cormorant behavior and attendance. Finally, we use a large-scale ongoing project at a site with extensive energy development in north-western Colorado to discuss future avenues for acoustic research. These include pairing acoustic recorders with camera traps to simultaneously examine mammalian and avian communities; determining the synergistic effects of noise and light pollution and habitat alteration; and how animal communities recover as the impacts of noise pollution diminish.</p> <br> The history of psychiatry and mental health services in  Bangalore/ India </br><br><p>Fools on the Hill: mental health care in Bangalore<br />Abstract: The National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-Sciences (NIMHANS) in Bangalore, India began as lunatic asylum, in 1848, when a separate asylum to care for the mentally ill was approved by Sir Mark Cubbon, Commissioner of Mysore in the Pettah area of Bangalore. This was based on the early experiences of Charles Irving Smith, who observed that mania was quite often a lethal disease, and needed a rather different kind of care. After the transfer of power from the British to the Kingdom of Mysore in 1881, it became, for a while, the only asylum to be supported by<br />a native kingdom. A larger mental hospital, in the light of the expanding population of Mysore, was thought essential by the 1920, when the Maharaja of Mysore approved the decision to build a new asylum. This was thought essential, as the population of Bangalore was expected to increase from 150,000 as it was then. The new building was finally completed in 1937, and by then had been renamed as the Mysore State Mental Hospital. Staff at<br />the hospital, who were part of the Mysore Medical Service, were sent to the Maudsley Hospital in London for training as specialists in psychiatry. They quickly incorporated the latest trends in medical science, from serology, biochemistry, physiology, imaging and physics, into the practice of psychiatry. The Maudsley itself had been charged with training psychiatrists for the Empire, at the end of the First World War, and had also gained many eminent &eacute;migr&eacute; clinicians and scientists from Germany as the Second World War loomed. As Indian independence came closer, the Mysore State Mental Hospital, and its staff, was recommended as the ideal<br />institution to begin training specialists in psychiatry and related mental health fields, for the region (east of the Suez). This came to fruition in 1953, after Independence, when it was designated as the All-India Institute of Mental Health (AIIMH), a few months before the All India Institute of Medical Sciences was established in Delhi. The mental hospital now houses the Department of Psychiatry at NIMHANS, and still looks after almost 500 in-patients. The asylum architecture, horticultural layout, high standards of mental health care and emphasis on scientific training initiated in the early part of the last century continue to provide a historical foundation to contemporary clinical practice, and research.</p>

<p>High tea will be served after the talk!<br />All are welcome!</p> <br> Cardiac Myosin Binding Protein-C is a critical regulator of cardiac function </br><br><p>Cardiac myosin binding protein-C (cMyBP-C) is a thick filament-associated protein that regulates cardiac contraction via its amino terminal (N&rsquo;) region. In vitro studies have suggested the importance of the first 271 N&rsquo;-residues of cMyBP-C (C0-C1f region) in slowing actin filament sliding over myosin to regulate cross-bridge cycling kinetics. However, the necessity of the C0-C1f region of cMyBP-C in regulating cardiac function in vivo has not been elucidated. The N&rsquo;-C0-C1f region of cMyBP-C is critical for proper cardiac function in vivo. Transgenic mice with 81% expression of a truncated cMyBP-C missing the N&rsquo;-C0-C1f region (cMyBP-C110kDa), compared to endogenous cMyBP-C, were generated and characterized at 3-months of age. cMyBP-C110kDa animals had a significant elevation in heart weight to body weight ratio and cardiac fibrosis compared to hearts from non-transgenic (NTG) littermates. Electron microscopy revealed normal sarcomere structure in cMyBP-C110kDa hearts but with apparently weaker cMyBP-C stripes. Furthermore, the ability of cMyBP-C to slow actin-filament sliding within the C-zone of native thick filaments isolated from NTG hearts was lost on thick filaments from cMyBP-C110kDa hearts. Short-axis M-mode echocardiography revealed a significant elevation in left ventricular internal diameter and a significant reduction in fractional shortening in cMyBP-C110kDa hearts compared to NTG hearts. Accordingly, we observed a significant increase in the expression of the hypertrophic genes MYH7 and NPPA by real-time PCR analysis. As expected, the expression levels of the MYBPC3 gene were significantly elevated in cMyBP-C110kDa hearts compared to NTG hearts. Surprisingly, our Western blot analyses revealed no significant difference in total cMyBP-C levels between NTG and cMyBP-C110kDa heart homogenates. However, intriguingly, we observed a significant increase in cMyBP-C phosphorylation at Ser-273, Ser-282, and Ser-302, sites important for cMyBP-C&rsquo;s regulation of actomyosin interaction, in cMyBP-C110kDa heart homogenates compared to those from NTG mice. The N&rsquo;-C0-C1f region of cMyBP-C is necessary for maintaining normal cardiac function in vivo.</p>
<p></p> <br> A study on myotendinous interactions and identification of novel candidates necessary for myotendinous development in Drosophila melanogaster </br><br><p>Musculoskeletal system of an animal is essential for various kinds of movements. Muscle is the contractile unit of the musculoskeletal system which is attached to bones (exoskeleton in invertebrates) via tendons. Tendons are connective tissue necessary for the development and function of muscles. Tendon-derived cues are necessary for proper muscle guidance and attachment during development. In our study, we did genetic perturbations in the tendon cells and analysed the outcome in context with muscle-tendon interaction. We performed a genetic screen using RNAi-mediated knockdown in the tendon cells to find out molecular players involved in the formation and maintenance of myotendinous junction (MTJ) and found 21 hits out of 1384 genes screened. Integrin-&beta;PS and Talin, picked as hits in this screen, are known to play important role in the MTJ formation. We have found novel candidates in context of MTJ formation.</p> <br> Uncovering the topology of eukaryotic vesicle traffic using Boolean models </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">In eukaryotic cells, the various cellular functions are partitioned into several<br />membrane bound compartments. Material is transported amongst the different compartments in small (~60nm) membrane bound packets called vesicles. The vesicle traffic system is a huge and complicated molecular interaction network that performs the functions of packaging of correct cargo molecules into vesicles, and the transport and fusion of these vesicles with their correct target compartments [Alberts B et al., 2002]. Thus the traffic system establishes a transport network, or a road map, on which molecules can be transported from one compartment to another.<br />Through experiments, the major molecular components of the vesicle traffic<br />machinery have been identified and the functions of these components have also been uncovered [Mellman, I., &amp; Emr, S. D., 2013]. In my PhD, using coarse-grained Boolean models, I have explored the link between the local molecular interactions that make up the vesicle traffic machinery and the global topology of the vesicle transport network.<br />We have developed a Boolean model of the vesicle traffic system in which arbitrary molecules interact amongst each other using Boolean logical rules. We statistically sample interaction rules to find the space of rules which encode for the observed topology of the real eukaryotic cell&rsquo;s vesicle transport network. We find that cisternal maturation, a topological feature that describes the mode of function of the Golgi apparatus, emerges spontaneously in the steady states of our model irrespective of the details of the interaction rules. The Golgi apparatus is an organelle that is present across all eukaryotes [Klute, M. J. et al, 2011] and the behaviour of its<br />compartments is a much debated topic in cell biology [Glick, B. S., &amp; Luini, A., 2011]. Recently, experimental evidence supporting the cisternal maturation model of the Golgi compartments has been found in mammalian and yeast cells [Mart&iacute;nez- Men&aacute;rguez et al, 2001; Losev, E. et al, 2006; Papanikou et al, 2015]. Golgi cisternal maturation involves three features: the formation of new cisternae at the cis-face of the Golgi, the maturation of cisternae in a cis to trans direction, coupled with recycle of Golgi-resident proteins on retrograde vesicles going from older to the immediately younger cisternae, and finally the dissipation by vesiculation of the terminal compartment. This complex topological feature is achieved in the steady states of our model without the inclusion of details such as reaction kinetics, spatial organization, etc. Our model also demonstrates that Golgi cisternal maturation need not have evolved over time through selection, rather, this feature is inherent to all traffic systems that are based on local molecular interactions.<br />We have also looked at how the particular interaction properties of SNAREs, which are components of the vesicle fusion machinery, affect the global topology of the traffic network. Vesicle fusion in cells depends on the ability of a SNARE protein present on the vesicle (v-SNARE) to form a complex with its cognate set of SNAREspresent on the target compartment (t-SNARE) [Jahn, R., &amp; Scheller, R. H., 2006]. Post-fusion, the SNARE complex is disassembled and the SNARE proteins are recycled for use in subsequent rounds of vesicle fusion [Malhotra, V. et al., 1988; S&uuml;dhof, T. C., &amp; Rothman, J. E., 2009]. SNARE recycle must additionally involve mechanisms to send the v-SNARE back to its source compartment. In our study, we formulate the mechanisms available to the eukaryotic cell for SNARE recycle and explore the constraints imposed by these mechanisms on the topology of the vesicle transport network.</p> <br> Ignoring the familiar : Cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying olfactory habituation.  </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Habituation is a simple form of learning in which an organism shows attenuated behavioral response to familiar stimuli.&nbsp; Ignoring familiar stimuli enables an organism to increase its perception and attention towards novel and relevant stimuli <em>(Rankin et al, 2009)</em>. We have exploited the well characterized olfactory system of Drosophila, to elucidate a generalizable and scalable circuit mechanism for habituation <em>(Ramaswami M, Neuron, 2014)</em>. Following odor exposure flies get habituated to the exposed odor. Based on the duration of odor exposure and the recovery profile, habituation is either Short Term (STH) or Long Term (LTH). Increased inhibition from the inhibitory local interneurons (LNs) onto excitatory projection neurons (PNs), in the antennal lobe underlies both STH and LTH <em>(Das et al, PNAS, 2011)</em>. Using this study as a foundation, in my Ph. D I have worked on two different aspects of habituation :</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a) &nbsp;The role of RNA regulatory proteins Fragile X Mental Retardation (FMRP) and Ataxin-2&nbsp; in translational regulation underlying habituation : LTH is associated with structural and functional plasticity of specific neurons and synapses. It is widely known that synaptic plasticity is dependent on RiboNucleoProtein (RNP) mediated neuronal translation. However memory related translational regulation had rarely been studied in-vivo. In the previously identified LN-PN synapses that underlie habituation we have therefore tested the role of FMRP and Atx2 in RNP assembly, mRNA translation and memory. Our results show that both FMRP and Atx2 are required specifically for LTH and not STH. FMRP and Atx2 interaction among themselves and other RNP components are crucial for habituation.&nbsp; In the LN-PN synapses, both jointly regulate the translation of transcripts like CaMKII required for LTH. However FMRP is dispensable and Atx2 is crucial for the assembly of RNPs indicative of shared as well as distinct roles <em>(Sudhakaran IP et al, PNAS, 2014)</em>. Multiple lines of evidence suggests that the prion like domains of RNA regulatory proteins play an importnat role in memory related translational regulation <em>(Si and Kandel, 2016; Sudhakaran IP and Ramaswami M, 2016)</em>. In this regard, we have also addressed how the putative prion like domains of Atx2 are involved in translational regulation underlying LTH.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">b) The role of recurrent/feedback inhibition in olfactory habituation:&nbsp; In the Drosophila antennal lobe, odorant specific olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and PNs both activate LNs that are capable of driving feed forward or feedback inhibition in the lobe. We hypothesized that a feedback from the PNs leading to sustained activation of the LNs could be functional in inducing the inhibitory potentiation of the LN-PN synapse. We tested this by expressing heat activated channels in the PNs to directly activate them and found that PN output is sufficient and necessary for driving habituation even in the absence of an odor exposure. PN-LN feedback inhibition was evident from results showing similar neuronal circuits mechanisms for PN activation induced habituation and odor induced habituation <em>(Sudhakaran IP et al., J. Neurosci, 2012)</em>. Considering the circuit motifs similar to that formed by the OSN-LN-PN neurons are widely repeated in the brain, our study also indicates that feedback potentiation of similar motifs could underlie habituation to other sensory modalities as well.</p> <br> Role of miRNAs in planarian regeneration </br><br><p>In recent years, the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea has emerged as a tractable model system to study stem cell biology and regeneration. &nbsp;Regeneration is a robust and complex process that involves several gene regulatory networks. One of the key gene regulatory networks is post transcriptional regulation, brought about by miRNAs. MicroRNAs are small RNA species that control gene expression by modulating translational repression and mRNA stability, thereby regulating various cellular processes. Here, we identify several miRNAs whose expression is enriched in neoblast population and in regenerating tissue at different time points in S.mediterranea suggesting their potential role in planarian stem cell function and regenrarion. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To understand the function of miRNAs in planarian regeneration, we focused on the family of miRNA, miR-124 that was enriched in the anterior regenerating tissue post 3 days amputation. We hypothesized that the miR-124 family might play a critical role in the brain regeneration. We performed knock down &nbsp;to study the function of miR-124 in planarian brain regeneration. &nbsp;The miR-124 family (miR-124) is highly conserved among metazoans and is shown to regulate neurogenesis by facilitating neural differentiation. However, its role in neural patterning and brain organization is not known. In this study we developed a novel method for delivering anti-miRs using liposomes for the functional knockdown (KD) of microRNAs. KD of Smed-miR-124 revealed a critical role for these miRNAs in neural patterning and organization during planarian brain regeneration. Our results also demonstrated an essential role for miR-124 in the generation of eye progenitors. Additionally we show a role for miR-124 in regulating Smed-slit-1, an axon guidance protein, either by targeting slit-1 mRNA or by potentially modulating the canonical Notch pathway. Together our results reveal a role for miR-124 in regulating the regeneration of both brain and visual system.</p> <br> Exploring cytoplasmic capping; a new player in gene expression regulation. </br><br><p>The mRNA cap is added in the nucleus and proteins that bind to the cap control much of the fate of an mRNA. Loss of the cap was thought to be an irreversible step in mRNA decay; however, the Schoenberg lab found evidence for re-capping of endonuclease cleavage products and identified a cytoplasmic population of mRNA capping enzyme (CE) that acts with a polynucleotide 5&rsquo; monophosphate kinase to restore the cap onto uncapped RNA.They also showed that recovery from stress was reduced in cells expressing an inactive form of cytoplasmic capping enzyme. Repression of cap- dependent translation is one of the earliest responses to cell stress. Non-translating mRNAs accumulate in stress granules (SGs) and processing bodies (PBs), which are also associated with changes in the turnover of selected mRNAs.</p>
<p>My studies identified mRNAs regulated by cytoplasmic capping. Cytoplasmic CE regulates translation of its targets by maintaining cap homeostasis, a cyclical process of decapping and recapping. These mRNAs encode proteins involved in nucleotide binding, RNA and protein localization and cell cycle regulation. I have also identified key components of cytoplasmic capping complex including Nck1, a cytoplasmic adaptor protein serving as a molecular scaffold to assemble this complex and RNA methyl transferase that adds methyl group to the recapped RNAs. While cytoplasmic capping itself is an exciting concept, my research additionally opened a new avenue suggesting novel role of cytoplasmic capping during cellular stress and recovery. Future studies will be directed to establish molecular regulation of cytoplasmic capping and the perturbation of cap homeostasis during recovery from stress and to identify if long non coding RNAs with 5&rsquo; cap are regulated by cytoplasmic capping.</p> <br> Targeting environmental and metabolic stress signaling to restore tissue homeostasis in aging related diseases. </br><br><p>The ability to respond to cues from environmental and metabolic stress is critical for tissue homeostasis, and dysfunction in this response can lead to loss of homeostasis and disease. In this talk I will describe our work in understanding environmental and metabolic signals in three different tissue contexts-eye, skeletal muscle, and lung tissues respectively. In the first part, I will describe our recent work in targeting the environmental detoxification pathway, Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) as an important driver of Age related macular degeneration (AMD). We have used human iPSC derived retinal cells, chemical biology, and metabolomics to identify novel small molecule- AhR activators that can prevent eye degeneration. In the second part of the talk I will describe our work in understanding the role of the essential branched chain amino acids (BCAA) in maintaining skeletal muscle homeostasis. It is known that with aging there is a rapid loss of skeletal muscle mass, and that signals from BCAA can slow this loss. Using Lipidomics and a mouse models of dysfunction in BCAA metabolism we have discovered novel BCAA derived lipids that may play a critical role in muscle repair and regeneration. We have also shown that the common anti-diabetic drug Metformin may have a therapeutic role in diseases of BCAA dysfunction. In the final part of the talk, I will briefly describe upon our current work in understanding metabolism of senescent cells. Senescent cells accumulate with aging and environmental damage. They are thought to be important drivers of aging itself and aging related pathologies. We have recently discovered that these cells generate arachidonic acid derived signals that may drive lung fibrosis, and selectively targeting this signaling pathway using small-molecules in mice may improve recovery from lung damage. In summary, this talk will describe the ability of chemical biology, metabolomics technology and disease models in uncovering fundamental mechanisms and therapeutic approaches for targeting aging and stress related degenerative diseases.</p> <br> To Be or Knot to Be </br><br><p>Knot theory is a branch of mathematical research in which one studies the mathematical formulation of the intuitive notion of a knotted piece of rope.The modern day origins of this topic lie in the earliest models of atom by Lorn Kelvin. Over the years, it has transcended its origin to become an important area of topology, with applications which range from string theory and robotics to statistical mechanics and DNA structures.</p>
<p>A fundamental problem of this area of research is to find algorithms to recognize if a given 2-dimensional picture of a entangled loop is actually 'knotted'. Very few such algorithms have been discovered.</p>
<p>In this talk, I intend to give a brief history of this area and the problem. I further intend to discuss a new implementable algorithm that was obtained in the course of an ongoing project with Meesum Syed, IMSc. The talk will have a strong popular math flavour, and should be accessible to everyone with a high school background in Math.</p> <br> FedExing signal by specialized filopodia, cytonemes: a novel mechanism of morphogen dispersion. </br><br><p>In multi-cellular organisms, millions of cells in developing organs<br />orchestrate their behavior and determine their relative position by<br />communicating with signaling cues. Although much progress has been made in&nbsp;recent years in identifying these conserved signaling molecules, how cells&nbsp;communicate with these macromolecular signaling proteins across dynamic,&nbsp;three-dimensional landscape remained a controversial problem in the field&nbsp;of Developmental Biology. Most existing models propose that signaling&nbsp;proteins diffuse in the extracellular space to generate concentration<br />gradients and that these extracellular gradients regulate growth,<br />migration, and patterning of target cells. However, a major focus of my&nbsp;research program is to understand a radically different mechanism - the&nbsp;&lsquo;direct delivery' of signals by specialized actin-rich signaling&nbsp;filopodia, named cytonemes. Recently, we demonstrated how cytonemes&nbsp;mediate cell to cell movement of Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF), an&nbsp;essential signaling protein in metazoan development, and how cells control&nbsp;cytonemes to generate and maintain a robust morphogenetic FGF gradient&nbsp;along<br />the growing branches of Drosophila trachea. Uncovering the mechanisms and&nbsp;strategies that the cells employ to spatiotemporally regulate signal&nbsp;exchange will have profound implications in our understanding of normal&nbsp;development and will provide the mechanistic framework for future to cure&nbsp;disease and to tissue engineering.</p> <br> Double Feature: the Death, Life and Afterlife of Film in India </br><br><p>The B film at 5pm will be an illustrated lecture "The Life&nbsp;and Death of Cinema: History and Chemistry" on film preservation in India, by&nbsp;David Farris.

Since then, MSC research has received enormous public and private investments, and these cells are currently used in hundreds of registered clinical studies, as well as in a rapidly growing industry of stem cell clinics. However, questions of whether &ldquo;MSCs&rdquo; are bona fide stem cells, and indeed whether the term refers to an actual biological entity, are increasingly controversial. I will discuss how scientific understanding of MSCs and their potential clinical uses has evolved, and implications of the ongoing debate for the field of &ldquo;stem cell&rdquo; research.</p> <br> Interaction of Membrane Cholesterol with G Protein-Coupled Receptors: Novel Insights in Health and Disease </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest class of molecules involved in signal transduction across membranes, and represent major drug targets in all clinical areas. The serotonin1A receptor is an important neurotransmitter receptor of the GPCR superfamily and is implicated in the generation and modulation of various cognitive, behavioral and developmental functions. We previously demonstrated that membrane cholesterol is necessary for ligand binding, and G-protein coupling of serotonin1A receptors. Interestingly, recently reported crystal structures of GPCRs have shown structural evidence of cholesterol binding site(s). In this context, we reported the presence of cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus (CRAC) motifs in the serotonin1A receptor. We also showed that the receptor is more stable and compact in the presence of membrane cholesterol. Our recent results utilizing coarse-grain molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the molecular nature of receptor-cholesterol interaction offer interesting insight in cholesterol binding site(s) in the receptor and oligomerization of the receptor. We showed utilizing homo-FRET that the serotonin1A receptor is constitutively oligomerized in live cells, with the possibility of higher order oligomers of the receptor. Progress in deciphering molecular details of the nature of GPCR-cholesterol interaction in the membrane would lead to better insight into our overall understanding of GPCR function in health and disease.</p> <br> Bacteria network for growth and survival </br><br><p>More than 50 years after William Hamilton laid the mathematical foundations of kin-selection theory, how cooperation among genetically distinct individuals evolves and is maintained remains one of the most fundamental and fascinating themes of evolutionary research. Here we tried to understand this conundrum by testing the effects of natural diversity within natural fruiting bodies of the social bacterium Myxococcus xanthus on total group spore productivity.</p>
<p>Myxococcus xanthus is a predatory soil bacterium that exhibits vegetative growth and multicellular fruiting body development as two distinct life history stages. It was previously demonstrated that genetically heritable social variation within fruiting bodies is common. Given the prevalent competition among individuals in natural microbial communities, factors that affect the maintenance of such natural within group variation remain unknown.</p>
<p>We asked whether natural within-group diversity has positive, negative or negligible effects on both total-group and individual-strain spore productivity using eight representative isolates derived from a single natural fruiting body. Interestingly, total spore productivity of chimeric populations containing all eight isolates was higher than expected from monoculture controls. Further analyses suggest that chimerism does not stimulate total productivity by affecting just one or two isolates, but rather a majority of the eight isolates respond positively to being mixed with the other seven isolates. Finally, we show that positive effects of mixing several isolates on total group productivity are specific to isolate sets that derive from the same fruiting body group, whereas any significant effects of chimerism on total productivity among isolates from different fruiting bodies were negative, and increasingly so as a function of mean distance between the soil sites from which fruiting bodies were derived.</p>
<p>Our study demonstrates what we believe are the first examples of chimeric synergy - i.e. positive effects of social chimerism on total group productivity - among conspecific microbes derived from the same natural social group. Furthermore, the positive effects of chimerism observed here may sometimes enhance the absolute fitness (and hence aid in survival) of a majority of group members. These studies also show the importance of maintaining precise spatial structure while sampling natural microbial populations so that information on spatial locations can be incorporated into analyses of interactions among members of local populations.</p> <br>  Identification of Key Signalling Pathways in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Stem Cells </br><br><p>MicroRNA182 (miRNA182) upregulation has been reported in several solid tumors and hematological malignancies but the mechanistic role is currently poorly understood. A particular question of both biological and clinical significance is the role of miRNA182 in contributing to the late stage of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) progression in the absence of TK (tyrosine kinase) gene mutations. Following an unbiased screen for potential microRNAs in the context of TKI (tyrosine kinase inhibitor) resistance, increased expression of miRNA182 was detected in Bcr-Abl-inhibited K562 cells. We further verified the increased expression of miRNA182 in other CML cell lines and in a panel of primary CML cells. Additionally, erythroid differentiation was found positively correlated with TKI resistance and ectopically expressed miRNA182 respectively. We undertook a strategy involving transient inhibition and complete knockout of MIR182 locus. CRISPR/Cas9 mediated MIR182 knockout successfully deleted the MIR182 locus in K562 cells. Transient inhibition of miRNA182 and &Delta;182 cells revealed biased and complete myeloid phenotypes respectively. The phenotype was rescued by ectopic expression of miRNA182-5p in &Delta;182 cells. Additionally, our experimental analysis of the role of Hes1, which is linked to miRNA182 through indirect evidence, further substantiates a role for the miRNA182- Hes1 axis in regulating the erythroid to myeloid switch. A conserved binding site at 3`UTR of Hes1 mRNA and rescue of Hes1 expression upon miRNA182 inhibition are suggestive of Hes1 as a putative target of miRNA182. Further, Hes1 overexpression increased myeloid differentiation and Hes1 downregulation increased erythroid differentiation. In conclusion, we reveal a key role for miRNA182 in regulating the differentiation of leukemic cells. We propose that the &Delta;182 cell line will be valuable in designing experiments for generating next generation pharmacological interventions. I undertook my thesis work in collaboration with a senior hematologist Cecil Ross of St. John&rsquo;s Medical College. The program evolved out of a joint hematology centric teaching program. The program was centered around hematology genomics and our approach was to develop platforms and in addition ask questions that addressed basic biological mechanisms in the context of therapies. Overall, the hematology program in our group has had three major overlapping themes</p>

Endocytosis of ligand-receptor complexes also plays an important role in fine tuning the signalling events that specify the identity of a cell or tissue during development. In particular, Clathrin and Dynamin-dependent (CD) endocytosis has been well studied in the context of patterning of the Drosophila wing discs. In the wing discs of Drosophila, apically secreted Wingless (Wg) encounters its receptor, DFrizzled2 (DFz2), resulting in a distinctive dorso-ventral pattern of signalling outputs thus patterning the dorso-ventral axis of the adult wing.</p>
<p>In my thesis, I have investigated the endocytic processes operating in the Drosophila wing disc in the context of the Wg signalling and patterning. I find that the Dynamin-independent CLIC/GEEC (Clathrin-Independent Carriers/ GPI-anchored proteins Enriched Early Endosomal Compartments) pathway, previously identified and characterised in tissue culture and primary cell lines1&ndash;3, functions in the wing disc epithelium as a major pathway for the endocytosis of the fluid-phase. To understand how the endocytosis of Wg occurs as well as to understand how it promotes signalling, I devised methods to directly track endocytosis of Wg and DFz2 in the wing disc epithelia as well as perturb the CLIC/GEEC (CG) and Clathrin-dependent (CD) pathways of endocytosis. I find that Wg is endocytosed from the apical surface of wing discs by CG endocytosis facilitated by its binding to PI-PLC sensitive GPI-anchored receptors.&nbsp; DFz2 appears to be endocytosed from the basolateral surface of wing discs by Clathrin-Dependent endocytosis. Wg and DFz2 interact optimally (3 times higher than on the cell surface) within the low pH milieu of the merged endosome carrying the ligand and receptor from different sub-cellular locations4. The endocytosis and subsequent merging of Wg and DFz2 endosomes is crucial for Wg signalling, the downstream events of which are possibly, initiated from the endosome. This study provides first evidence for a mechanism wherein cells leverage multiple endocytic pathways to coordinate signalling during patterning. It remains to be seen if this novel strategy in signalling is also applicable in other signalling contexts.</p>

<p></p> <br> Evolving resistance to an aminoglycoside in E. coli. </br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bacteria live in constantly changing environments and are often subject to different forms of stress. Due to the recent colossal use and misuse of antibiotics, bacteria are increasingly facing antibiotic stress which has resulted in the global emergence and dissemination of drug-resistant strains. Dealing with this problem requires an understanding of how antibiotics kill cells and how resistant cells counter their action.</p>
<p>In this thesis, I explore the evolution of resistance, by the gain of genomic mutations, to the aminoglycoside kanamycin in E. coli. To understand how resistance-conferring evolutionary trajectories are influenced by the concentration of kanamycin I performed in-vitro evolution of laboratory E. coli under sublethal concentrations of kanamycin over short time durations. I found that the early dynamics of the development of resistance was dependent on the levels of stress (concentration) imposed by the antibiotic. Fixation of less-costly kanamycin-resistant mutants occurred earlier in populations growing at a lower sublethal concentration of the antibiotic when compared to those growing at higher sublethal concentrations; in the latter, resistant mutants with a significant growth defect persisted for longer. Point mutations in domain IV of the translation elongation factor EF-G provided low-cost high-level resistance to kanamycin, while deletions in the C-terminal end of the ATP synthase shaft conferred high-cost basal-level resistance.</p>
<p>The resistance of the EF-G mutants could be increased by second site mutations in the genes rpoD / cpxA / topA / cyaA. I show that the mutation in cpxA most likely results in an active Cpx stress response. Further evolution of an EF-G mutant under a higher concentration of kanamycin identified the cpxA locus as the primary target for the next significant increase in resistance. I show that the mutation in cyaA results in a loss of catalytic activity and probably results in resistance via altered CRP function. Despite a reduction in cAMP levels, the CyaAN600Y mutant had a transcriptome indicative of increased CRP activity, pointing to an unknown non-catalytic role for CyaA in gene expression. I show that the large-scale transcriptomic changes in the topoisomerase I (FusAA608E-TopAS180L) mutant likely result from increased negative supercoiling in the cell. From the transcriptomes of mutants, I describe the epistasis between the mutation in EF-G and these second site mutations. Finally, genes with known roles in aminoglycoside resistance were present among the misregulated genes in the mutants.</p>
<p>Thus, these experiments have uncovered the early dynamics in the evolution of resistance to kanamycin and elucidated how the activities of mutated gene products were modified to confer resistance.</p> <br> Protein engineering approaches to dissect specificity in cell signaling </br><br><p>Cells are packed with a high density of proteins, whose interactions drive most physiological processes. Aberrant protein-protein interactions are very often implicated in many debilitating or fatal diseases such as diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer. Cell signaling emerges from an ensemble of dynamic, transient, protein-protein interactions in crowded cellular environments. Established structural and cell biological techniques are mostly limited to addressing the function of stable protein complexes, and do not address emergent behavior stemming from multiple transient interactions. My research program centers on the concept that protein interaction networks in cells have evolved to harness multi-protein interactions, requiring in cell biochemical measurements of cellular processes and in vitro reconstitution of transient multi-protein assemblies. We use a genetically encoded technique called Systematic Protein Affinity Strength Modulation that allows us to control protein interactions both in vitro and in cells to understand the molecular mechanisms that dictate context-dependent specificity in G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and kinases. I will present recent work highlighting the synergistic effects of G proteins on GPCR signaling, and the biochemical basis of substrate-specificity in protein kinases.</p> <br> TBA </br><br><p>TBA</p> <br> Centrosomes and cilia in human brain development and cancer </br><br><p>Centrosomes and cilia are conserved cellular structures essential for<br />organism development. Mutations resulting in defective centrosomes and&nbsp;cilia cause microcephaly, a developmental disorder where brain size is&nbsp;severely reduced. On the other hand, centrosome amplification is&nbsp;frequently identified as a hallmark of human cancers. Dissecting&nbsp;pathobiological mechanisms of microcephaly and centrosome amplification in&nbsp;cancer was not possible due to the restricted availability of suitable in&nbsp;vitro models that can reliably recapitulate complex human tissues. As an&nbsp;example, the complexity of neural epithelial tissues limit modeling of&nbsp;neurodevelopmental diseases and the translation of basic brain research&nbsp;into clinical use. In order to address this question, we have generated&nbsp;iPSC-derived human brain organoids (mini brains in dish) to study&nbsp;brain development and to model diseases.</p>
<p>In my seminar, I will explain about the development of human brain<br />organoids and their use in modelling microcephaly. In addition, sharing&nbsp;our preliminary data, I shall highlight how we will use these brain&nbsp;organoids to model glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). In second part of&nbsp;seminar, I will discuss how we exploited chemical biological tools and&nbsp;identified small molecule inhibitors that specifically target cancer&nbsp;cells exhibiting high incidence of centrosome amplification.</p> <br> miR-27b mediates deregulation of energy metabolism in breast cancer </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, non-coding RNA which participate in gene regulation by targeted silencing of designated mRNA transcripts. Recently, it has become clear that dysfunctional miRNA expression contributes to the deregulation of key signaling pathways underlying oncogenic initiation and progression. MicroRNA-27b is one such pro-oncogenic miRNA, and is frequently upregulated in breast cancer. This project seeks to further characterize miR-27b&rsquo;s role in breast cancer by identifying novel targets under its control. Initial experiments implicate Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Protein X (PDHX)&mdash;an indispensable structural component of the Pyruvate Dehydrogenase complex&mdash;to be a probable target. Of relevance, a hallmark of cancer cell metabolism is their propensity to rapidly consume glucose, owing to increased glycolytic flux which is unaccompanied by a corresponding increase in downstream oxidative metabolism. This adaptation liberates the end products of glycolysis for use as precursors in biosynthetic reactions driving tumor growth. By suppressing PDHX, miR-27b appears to facilitate glycolytic metabolism, conferring a growth advantage to cancer cells. Our expression profiling identified that PDHX levels are indeed significantly reduced in breast tumor tissues and cell lines harboring elevated miR-27b, supporting the notion that miR-27b alters cancer cell metabolism, specifically by targeting PDHX in breast cancer. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel association between PDHX and miR-27b in which the tumor suppressive effect of PDH is mitigated by an oncogenic miRNA; furthermore, the awareness of this interaction provides the context for our observations indicating that pharmacologic activation of PDH represents a feasible and unique strategy for treating breast cancer. Also, we identified a novel small molecule inhibitor that specifically targets miR-27b and inhibits cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo effects are currently being pursued.</p> <br> Integrative modeling of biomolecular assembly structures and pathways </br><br><p>The networks and spatial structures of biomolecular interactions provide insights into their function and thus help us to understand the workings of living cells. Detailed structural characterization of large and often dynamic assemblies and their networks is generally impossible by any single existing experimental or computational method. This challenge can be overcome by hybrid approaches that integrate data from diverse biophysical experiments (eg, X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, electron microscopy, chemical cross-linking, yeast-two hybrid system, and various chemical genetics and proteomics approaches). We formulate the hybrid approach to structure and/or network determination as an optimization problem, the solution of which requires three main components: the representation of the assembly or network, the scoring function, and the optimization method. The ensemble of solutions to the optimization problem embodies the most accurate characterization given the available information. The key challenges remain translating experimental data into restraints on the structure and/or network, combining these spatial and/or network restraints into a single scoring function, optimizing the scoring function, and analyzing the resulting ensemble of solutions. The approach will be illustrated by several applications to specific biological systems, including the structure determination of the nuclear pore complex and the mapping of the gulonate pathway in <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>.</p> <br> Drugs from bugs: learning from insects is learning to win </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Infectious diseases area mong the leading causes for human morbidity and mortality worldwide. Pathogens are fast acquiring resistance to antibiotics, outcompeting new drug development for the treatment of infections. Increasing demand for new antibiotics has initiated exploration of natural bioresources from diverse origins. Insects are evolutionarily the most successful group of organism in terms of biodiversity, both at the species and molecular level, and are thus expected to lead to a prolific compound library of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that can be explored for developing novel anti-infectives. We have identified diverse spectra of AMPsfrom selected insect species such as the greater wax moth Galleria mellonellaand the Asian ladybeetleHarmonia axyridis. The functions of these AMPs are evolutionarily determined, which include inhibiting notable human pathogens like Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria monocytoges, uropathogenic E. coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Candida albicans.In addition, our work encompasses establishment of G. mellonella as a model host for (i) human pathogens, (ii) high-throughput screening of large compound libraries, (iii) studying host-parasite coevolution, and (iv) epigenetic basis of diseases. Here, we discuss the biomolecular aspects of insect biodiversity to create promising candidates asnew products or servicesto be applied in medicine and agriculture.</p> <br> Population dynamics and adaptation in constant and fluctuating environments: role of dispersal and maternal effects. </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Population size fluctuations are inversely related to population persistence as they increase the probability of attainment of extinction-prone low population sizes. I will talk about my research which&nbsp;used a combination of theoretical simulations and laboratory experiments&nbsp;to examine the role of ecologically relevant factors such as dispersal and crowding on the stability of spatially structured metapopulations and unstructured single population units, facing temporally constant&nbsp;environments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While density-dependent feedback effects (on population growth rate) alone&nbsp;can drive population size fluctuations in constant environments, an&nbsp;additional challenge is imposed when a population faces temporally&nbsp;fluctuating environments: individuals need to switch between optimal&nbsp;phenotypic states (corresponding to fluctuating environmental states) to&nbsp;avoid environmentally driven population size fluctuations. I will present&nbsp;the results of an experiment targeted to test a long-standing hypothesis&nbsp;that 'pre-existing' maternal effect driven transgenerational phenotypic&nbsp;plasticity will enhance long-term population performance by buffering&nbsp;environmentally driven population fluctuations, only when individuals are&nbsp;provided with reliable environmental cue. Although the results showed that&nbsp;transgenerational phenotypic plasticity via 'pre-existing' maternal&nbsp;effects can increase long-term population performance in temporally&nbsp;fluctuating environments, they did not prove that commonly seen&nbsp;'pre-existing' maternal effects in animals and plants are adaptive. I will&nbsp;present the results from laboratory evolution experiments targeted to&nbsp;explicitly test the adaptive significance of maternal effects. Results&nbsp;showed maternal effects can evolve under novel temporally fluctuating&nbsp;environments to facilitate adaptation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I will also talk about my future research plans. I plan to use an &nbsp;eco-evolutionary laboratory experimental platform to understand the relative adaptive significance of within- and transgenerational phenotypic&nbsp;plasticity, and how their evolution can affect population size dynamics.</p> <br> Characterising Wildlife Populations: From Individuals to Landscapes </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Our understanding about the dynamics of wildlife populations has been&nbsp;unjustifiably poor even for some of the world's most iconic wildlife&nbsp;species. Most scientific studies about wildlife populations appear to ignore&nbsp;one of the three necessary aspects for producing good science: good&nbsp;questions, good methods and good data. As a result, the growth of our&nbsp;knowledge about wildlife has been very slow and this has proven to be costly&nbsp;for wildlife ecology and conservation. In this talk, I argue for the need to&nbsp;tightly, and directly, link ecological theory to statistical methods to&nbsp;field biology in studies of wildlife populations. With this background, and&nbsp;motivated by charismatic large mammals of Asia and Africa, I will discuss&nbsp;some of the research problems I have been working on and will provide a&nbsp;blueprint of the research program I have in mind going into the future.</p> <br> Prevention and early detection of urological malignancies. </br><br><p>As the incidence of cancers are rising and 30 % of all cancers are urological cancers.

<p>ALL ARE WELCOME</p> <br> Maternal Reign On Vertebrate Embryogenesis â€“ Good, Bad Or Ugly? </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Mammalian embryos exposed to heat either directly or by maternal hyperthermia due to febrile illnesses develop severe developmental abnormalities including neural tube and cardiovascular defects. Transient heat shock of zebrafish embryos culminates in developmental defects and embryonic lethality analogous to that observed in mammals. Studies on teratogenic effects of heat in mammals have shown that embryos are heat susceptible during the first couple of cytokinesis phases and acquire resilience at later stages. The acquisition of heat resilience takes several cell cycles and is co-incident with the ability to evoke a protective heat shock response. We discovered the existence of teratogen resilient developmental windows in zebrafish embryos within the first mitosis phase when embryos cannot mount a protective response due to transcriptional quiescence. I will discuss our attempts to provide a mechanistic understanding of such teratogen resilient developmental windows during the maternally controlled phase of embryonic development and its relevance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /> Transcriptional quiescence is a conserved metazoan phenomenon during maternally controlled phases of development. Alterations in genome quanta from the endogenous diploid state is thought to affect onset of zygotic genome activation (ZGA) and biological scaling processes in the developing embryo, which mark the end of maternal control of embryonic development. I will also discuss our ongoing research on the mechanisms of ZGA and cell biological scaling in zebrafish embryos.</p> <br> The colour and colour vision of birds </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">The spectacular diversity of colours in nature remain largely unexplained. Why is one species of bird living in the forest blue and another species red? I compare two groups of birds: the Old World warblers of the Himalayas, which are all rather similar in colour (green and pale yellow), and the distantly related New World warblers of North America, which can be red, blue, yellow and all colours in between.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I argue that we can gain insights into the causes of colour variation by asking if different species of birds see colour differently from each other. For example, red birds may perceive many more different shades of red than blue birds. I describe the basics of colour vision in humans, which is by far the best understood species in this respect, and then consider what we know about birds, and the limited information on whether different species of birds do indeed differ in how they see colours.</p> <br> TBA </br><br><p>TBA</p> <br> Dragonflies in Space </br><br><p>Residents of mating territories must choose locations to occupy at a number of different spatial scales: general breeding area, location of territory within the breeding area, and location within the territory. The costs and benefits associated with different options will likely be affected by interactions with different categories of conspecifics; for male residents of mating territories, interacting with other males is likely costly, while interaction with females is beneficial.&nbsp; In this talk, I will present results of a variety of observational and experimental field studies examining space use by male eastern amberwing dragonflies (Perithemis tenera) at the within-breeding area and within-territory scales. Specifically, these studies investigate whether the use of space by residents corresponds to what would be expected if they select locations based on the benefits and costs of interacting with different classes of conspecifics.</p> <br> 3D Biology : Simultaneous Digital Profiling of RNA, DNA & Protein </br><br><p>Nanostring nCounter platform is enabling digital counting of molecules<br />without PCR amplification. In this seminar Dr. Erroll Rueckert will discuss on<br />how this technology empowers translational research work and<br />simultaneously detects RNA, DNA and protein from the same sample. In<br />addition, recently released plex-set technology, which facilitates multiplexing<br />genes and samples together will be discussed. The evidence will be<br />provided through case studies.</p> <br> Chemical Immunology: Cell-specific perturbations of immune microenvironments  </br><br><p>Immune microenvironments are composed of a collection of immune cells present during inflammation exhibiting common mechanisms across different diseases. Such common mechanisms give rise to &ldquo;defects&rdquo; in similar immune cell types exhibiting pathogenic or therapeutic functions across different diseases, e.g. alleviating immune suppression (immune checkpoint) can treat cancers but also cause autoimmunity (type-1 diabetes), as well as, the defects occurring in immune cell suppression during an autoimmune disease can be leveraged to treat cancer. We are focused on developing chemical entities to modulate the &ldquo;common&rdquo; suppressive immune cell types specific to three diseases categories (cancer, neurodegeneration and diabetes) of our interest.</p>
<p>The development of drug resistance is a significant problem in cancer therapy that leaves many patients without effective treatment alternatives. Cancer immunotherapy is a promising alternative that harnesses the immune system to generate a broad-spectrum antitumor response. However, immunotherapy can be undermined by immune suppression mediated by tumor cells as well as pro-tumor immune cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) that accumulate in the tumor microenvironment. While immune checkpoint blockade drugs (e.g. anti-CTLA4, anti-PD1 antibodies) shows strong potential in relieving immune suppression, other mechanisms are more difficult to control, specifically for solid tumors. Thus, there is great need for a dual-action therapeutic capable of targeting tumor cells and MDSC in the microenvironment without impairing antitumor immunity.</p>
<p>During the talk, I will present our work using our interactome based drug design program (CANDOCK) with &ldquo;network&rdquo; as the target compared to single target approaches to design and synthesize non-toxic single chemical entities (small molecules) with dual action of anti-disease (potent anti-cancer compounds) activity, as well as, altering the function of suppressive immune cells (MDSCs, CD8+ T-cells) for disease-specific immunotherapy in vivo. I will also show results of our recent ongoing clinical trial immunotherapy in pet dogs. These preliminary data suggest that our potent dual-action anticancer lead has the potential to be used as a cancer immunotherapeutic and warrants the generalization of our approach to develop disease and cell-specific immunotherapies that can also be used as &ldquo;probes&rdquo; to explore cell-responsive pathways in vivo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br> The landscape of co-evolutionary constraints in the sequence-space of biological macromolecules reflects their folding and assembly constraints </br><br><p>How do the nascent polypeptide chains fold into specific three-dimensional structures within fractions of seconds? How do the individual subunits of macromolecular complexes self-assemble into massive molecular machines? Do these macromolecular events left any signature in their sequence space? The concept of co-evolution emerged from the mutual relationships among species in the complex ecological networks. Availability of molecular data facilitated co-evolution analysis at the molecular level, revealing the fact that co-evolution exists among physically interacting proteins, interacting domains of the same protein and even among proximal amino acids of the same or two interacting proteins. We have also participated in this endeavor by exploring the predictive power of co-evolutionary techniques to capture the thermodynamics and kinetic constraints of protein folding and macromolecular complex self- assembly (1-4). We construct networks of co-evolving residue sites of our biomolecules of interest and demonstrate that functional constraints associated with their folding / self-assembly mechanisms are strong predictors of co-evolutionary patterns. In complex self-assembly processes (ribosome), predictors of co-evolution include cooperativity phenomenon, protein-induced rRNA reconstitutions, molecular packing of different rRNA domains, protein&ndash;rRNA recognition and so on (1). A correlation between folding rate of small globular proteins and their topological features is known. We have introduced an analogous topological characteristic for co-evolutionary constraints, which allows us to differentiate between ribosomal domains subjected to rapid reconstitutions from those hindered by kinetic traps (1). The same topological parameter captures protein folding rates with very high accuracy (2) and further predicts alterations of folding rates upon point-mutations (3). Furthermore, co-evolutionary patterns are useful to prediction of potential antibiotic targeting sites (1). Our recent endeavor depicts the power of co-evolutionary techniques to capture the self-assembly pathway of macromolecular complexes (4). These observations reveal that the temporal order of molecular events taking place during the folding of single proteins or that during complex self-assembly are imprinted in their sequence-space. This may be a step toward understanding the designing principles of biological proteins and their complexes.</p>

Although several key upstream pathogen sensors (e.g., TLRs, RIG-I and NLRs), and the pivotal downstream molecules that drive the anti-pathogen response (e.g., NF&kappa;B, MAP kinase, Interferons) are well characterized, a comprehensive understanding of the cellular proteins and pathways that integrate the regulation of these mechanisms is currently lacking. Similarly, genetic variations in several genes are known to cause deregulated innate immune and inflammatory response induced pathologies; however, how these genetic variations alter immune response signaling is less understood. This talk will present a human genome-scale comparative view of the regulatory proteins impacting the anti-viral (TLR3) and anti-bacterial (NOD2) pathways. Furthermore, the identification of several genes associated with inflammatory diseases as regulators of innate immune pathways and their characterization will also be discussed.</p> <br> A Talk on Laser Scanning Imaging Cytometer </br><br><p>Acumen&reg; Cellista&mdash;Laser Scanning Imaging Cytometer</p>

Noted initially as a form of lipodystrophy, these complications include severe dyslipidemia, accelerated diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, osteoporosis, chronic renal failure and dementia. While many of the metabolic complications were attributed to adverse effects of the antiretroviral drugs, our group has focused on the possibility that they might arise from direct effects of the virus per se. We followed a translational route to test this hypothesis, beginning with metabolic and lipid kinetic studies of patients with lipodystrophy to uncover the critical biochemical defects, primarily in adipose tissue physiology. We then used a variety of cellular and molecular methods, as well as a transgenic mouse model, to determine that viral protein R (Vpr), a product of the HIV genome, could induce the cardinal biochemical effects and metabolic outcomes seen in HIV patients. The effects include lipodystrophy, diabetes and fatty liver disease, and the underlying mechanisms involve dysregulation of an array of host transcription factors responsible for lipid and glucose homeostasis. Thus HIV directly alters adipose metabolism; conversely, we have recently found that adipose tissue serves as a large and hitherto unsuspected reservoir for HIV-infected T cells, and likely promotes viral latency.</p> <br> Mechanisms underlying light control of plant growth </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Plants adjust their body plan in response to ambient environmental conditions. Light is among the most relevant environmental signals because light not only drives photosynthesis but also provides critical information about the local growth environment as well as diurnal and seasonal time. Light is perceived by a complex array of photoreceptors, defined by the color of light they absorb. These include the red/far-red-absorbing phytochromes (phyA-E), the blue/UV-A-absorbing cryptochromes (CRY1-2), phototropins (phot1-2), and ZTL-family, and a UV-B-absorbing receptor. Plants have developed various adaptive responses in interpreting and utilize light directionality, quantity, and quality. One such adaptive response is the ability of sun-loving plants to sense and avoid vegetational shading by nearby plants. In vegetational or canopy shading, plants perceive a decrease in the ratio of red to far-red light (R: FR) and there is also a reduction in blue light and the available photosynthetically active radiation (P R). CRYs control the phenotypic plasticity of plants in response to changes in blue light. Despite their importance, very little is known about the mechanisms by which CRYs affect growth programs. We present data to show that when plants are deprived of blue light under a shaded canopy, CRY1/2 perceive this change and respond by directly contacting two bHLH transcription factors, PIF4 and PIF5. Shade avoidance responses leads to contrasting growth responses in different organs of the plant; for example, the stem and petiole elongates at the expense of other organs so that the plant can capture more light than its neighbors. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying such contrasting response is unknown. Here we will describe how different organs and tissues respond to the same stimuli during this adaptive response which is of agricultural importance.</p> <br> Role of IP3 signalling in neurons regulating nutrient sensing </br><br><p>TBA</p> <br> TBA </br><br><p>TBA</p> <br> Molecular principles for optimizing protein-DNA interactions </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Interactions between proteins and nucleic acids are ubiquitous and central to the life of cells. The remarkable efficiency and specificity of protein-DNA recognition presents a major theoretical puzzle given the size of the genome, the large number of molecular species in vivo at a given time, and the crowded environment they inhabit. The fast association between proteins and DNA is governed by nonspecific interactions that allow protein sliding along DNA where the protein binds DNA nonspecifically and performs a helical motion when it is placed in the major groove. We have explored using various computational approaches the interplay between the molecular characteristics of the proteins (e.g., DNA recognition motifs, degree of flexibility, and oligomeric states) and the nature of sliding, intersegment transfer events and the overall efficiency of the DNA search. Another important aspect of the search is how the in-vivo conditions (for example, crowding in the cell or coverage of DNA by nucleosomes) affect the efficiency of DNA search. Protein sliding may occur on single-stranded DNA as well, yet via a different mechanism than that for double-stranded DNA. Furthermore, the interaction between proteins and DNA also has to result with high affinity complexes. In my presentation, I will discuss the molecular features of proteins and of the nucleic acids that allow fast dynamics and high affinity binding on both single- and double-stranded DNA.</p> <br> Dipole Organization and Membrane Biophysics: A Tale of Two Studies </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Biological membranes are complex assemblies of lipids and proteins that allow cellular compartmentalization and act as an interface, through which cells communicate with each other and with the external milieu.&nbsp; In physical terms, membranes can be treated as a complex oriented fluid which is a weakly coupled, non-covalent, and anisotropic assembly of molecules in two-dimensions, and can therefore be treated as soft matter.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this lecture, I will focus on the application of red edge excitation shift (REES) and membrane dipole potential to explore organization and dynamics of membrane lipids and proteins.&nbsp; Both these phenomena are dependent on organization of membrane dipoles.</p>

Specifically, I will highlight two research projects illustrating how computational approaches can be used to study metabolic networks.</p>
<p>First, I will talk about an algorithm we have developed to efficiently predict synthetic lethal deletions in a metabolic network. This is a computationally challenging problem, involving the solution of large mixed-integer linear programming problems, or alternatively, a large number of linear programming problems. We devised a strategy to surmount the computational complexity of previous approaches, by iteratively reducing the search space for synthetic lethals, resulting in a substantial reduction in running time. Our approach is readily parallelisable, leading to further savings, and enabling the analysis of synthetic lethals at a very different scale.</p>
<p>Next, I will talk about a graph-mining based approach, to identify pathways for synthesis of novel compounds. We first describe a reliable method based on subgraph edit distance to map reactants and products in a reaction, using only their chemical structures. Subsequently, we identify the reaction centre and its neighbourhood, the reaction signature, and store this in a reaction rule network. This novel representation enables us to rapidly predict pathways, even between previously unseen molecules. We also propose a heuristic that predominantly recovers natural biosynthetic pathways from amongst hundreds of possible alternatives. Our method can be used to predict probable pathways for retrosynthesis of new molecules, as well as for "gap-filling" in existing metabolic networks.</p> <br> Insights into Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-mediated protein-protein interactions within the Toll-like receptor signalling pathway through computational approaches </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;"></p>
<p>Pattern-recognition receptors confer the innate immune system the ability to defend and protect the host from infectious microorganisms through detection of conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) present in a variety of microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses. The Toll-like receptors constitute one class of PRRs and are characterised by a N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, a transmembrane domain and a C-terminal Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain. In addition to the receptors, there also exist TIR domain-containing adaptor proteins. Ligand binding to the LRR domain of TLR initiates downstream signalling which is mediated by interactions between the TIR domains of the receptor and adaptor protein as well as among adaptor proteins. Different combinations of receptor and adaptor proteins result in different signalling outputs.</p>
<p>Despite considerable progress in the area of TLR signalling, the absence of a TLR-adaptor complex structure limits our knowledge of TLR-adaptor interactions due to the weak and transient nature of TIR-TIR interactions. Mutagenesis studies and structural analysis have identified regions on the TIR domain of these proteins crucial for mediating TIR-TIR interactions. While the phenotypes associated with these mutations are well-understood, their effect on the structure and subsequent interactions with other TIR domain-containing proteins remains poorly understood.</p>
<p>Recent advances in high-speed computing have enabled researchers to investigate aspects of biological mechanisms that fall beyond the scope of experimental techniques, thereby advancing our understanding of these mechanisms. During my Ph.D research, I have employed various computational approaches-molecular dynamics simulations, structural modelling, protein-protein interaction analyses and protein structure network analyses to investigate the effect of these mutations on the dynamics and inter-residue networks of TIR-TIR interactions. In this seminar, I will be discussing the results of this thesis work, the conclusions drawn from these observations and how these will assist in an improved understanding of TIR-TIR interactions.</p>

<p></p> <br> A Red Fluorescent Protein (Sandercyanin) form Blue Fish (Sander Vitreus) </br><br><p>The walleye (Sander vitreus) is&nbsp;a commercial and sport fish that inhabits the Northern American lakes. Recently it has been observed that the North American walleye is turning blue. Schaefer et al. (2014) have hypothesized that the increased blue color is an adaptation to increased exposure to UV radiation near the north pole. The underlying molecular basis of its adaptation to increased UV radiation is the presence of a protein (Sandercyanin)&ndash;ligand complex in the mucus of walleyes. Degradation of heme by UV radiation results in the formation of Biliverdin IX&alpha; (BLA), the chromophore bound to Sandercyanin.&nbsp;UV radiation is known to cause breakdown of heme in blood to BLA that combines with Sandercyanin in the skin mucus - possibly produced in sacciform cells in the epidermis of the fish. BLA- binding results in the formation of the blue colored Sandercyanin that possibly protects the walleye from UV radiation by acting as a natural sunscreen.</p>
<p>Serendipitously, Sandercyanin also shows interesting fluorescence properties.&nbsp;We have described the spectral properties and molecular structures of Sandercyanin. Sandercyanin shows strong far-red fluorescence (&lambda;max = 675 nm) in the mucosal cells of walleye, when excited by UV radiation (&lambda;max&nbsp;= 375 nm) and red (&lambda;max&nbsp;= 630 nm). We also show that the apo protein is monomeric in solution that forms stable homo tetramers on addition of BLA to the protein. A structure of the Sandercyanin&ndash;BLA complex, purified from the fish mucus, reveals a glycosylated protein with a lipocalin fold. Spectral properties and high- resolution atomic structures of Sandercyanin elucidate the molecular basis of BLA- binding and observed fluorescent properties. Unlike all other known biliverdin-bound fluorescent proteins, the chromophore is non covalently bound to the protein. Monomeric Sandercyanin is an 18.6-kDa protein and&nbsp;is, by far, the smallest (in sequence), ligand-inducible far-red fluorescent protein reported from a vertebrate. It is the first lipocalin where biliverdin-inducible fluorescence is demonstrated. Sandercyanin has interesting spectral properties of having a large spectral shift, which makes it distinct from other known fluorescent proteins. The unique spectral properties of Sandercyanin support its proposed role in protecting against UV radiation. Sandercyanin might be further engineered as a chromophore-inducible far-red fluorescent protein of small size and large spectral shift with potential use as a fluorescent protein marker and in deep-tissue imaging.</p>

An understanding of nervous system function and development is what we seek. Such knowledge will also provide mechanistic insight into neurological disease conditions. We use the cerebellum in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) as our model system. The cerebellum is one of the oldest parts of the brain and is present in all vertebrates. Zebrafish and mammals diverged from a common ancestor around 450 million years ago. Yet, the zebrafish cerebellum is very similar to the mammalian cerebellum in its anatomy and circuitry. Thus, fundamental principles that govern cerebellar function and development can be formulated by studying the zebrafish cerebellum.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Purkinje neurons are essential for cerebellar function, yet, neither their activity patterns in vivo, nor the computation they perform are understood clearly. By recording activity patterns from single Purkinje neurons, we showed that these neurons exhibit membrane potential bistability. I will discuss the implications of bistability on calcium imaging, a technique that is widely used for monitoring activity across neuronal populations. I will also show how bistability could lead to adaptive encoding of efference copy in Purkinje neurons. The stereotyped synaptic connections impinging on Purkinje neurons are critical for its function. Using a combination of techniques, we showed that connexin-35 (Cx35) mediated gap junctions regulate glutamatergic synaptogenesis onto Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum. In sum, we have made significant inroads in unraveling mechanisms of cerebellar circuit function and development. In the future, we hope to expand these efforts by integrating optogenetic stimulation, electrophysiology and imaging techniques.</p> <br> Ensemble Coding in Amygdala Circuits </br><br><p>"Ensemble Coding in Amygdala Circuits"</p>

However, how synapticactivity controls the regulatory mechanisms involved in local protein synthesis is notclear. miRNA activity is one mechanism by which protein synthesis can be acutelyregulated. To explore activity-dependent local miRNA regulation of protein synthesis,we designed and developed a fluorescent probe to report miRNA biogenesis and examined localtranslational regulation by synaptic activity. I will discuss synaptic control of local miRNA biogenesis, which, in turn, regulates local protein synthesis to increase the precision androbustness of synaptic modifications during plasticity. In the second part of my talk, I will give brief insights into the proposed research on novel synaptic signalling mediated by metal ions.</p> <br> Phenotype-driven Precision Oncology (PDPO)-guiding clinical decisions one patient at-a-time </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Precision medicine requires treatment individualization taking into account not only patient and tumor factors, but also intra-tumor heterogeneity and tumor evolution through time. We propose that the next generation of personalized precision drugs will come from the development of physiologically relevant &ldquo;real- or accelerated-time&rdquo; models of individual patient-specific tumors, that mimic tumor pathology, and progression. Importantly, such models could serve as a powerful personalized screening platform for clinical genomics-informed predictions for genetic and therapeutic vulnerabilities that can subsequently be used to provide testable therapeutic and diagnostic modalities in the clinic. With that in mind, we have developed a bank of primary patient-derived xenograft (PDx), and microtumor/primary cell line (PDmT/PDC)models of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs), and colorectal cancers (CRCs) that are amenable to high-throughput and high-content screens (HTS/HCS). Using comprehensive tumor profiling studies, and single cell transcriptomics in conjunction with image-based phenotypic screens, we are beginning to uncover novel therapeutic vulnerabilities, as well as key driver genes/pathways and their function that may regulate cancer metastasis and evolution of drug resistance, the two most common causes of cancer-related mortality.</p> <br> A Structural Perspective on the Evolution of Protein Functions </br><br><p>Powerful tools for comparing protein structures and protein sequences have allowed us to analyse proteins from nearly 20,000 completed genomes and identify 2700 evolutionary domain superfamilies. These superfamilies cover nearly 70% of domains from all kingdoms of life and are captured in our resource (CATH-Gene3D). &nbsp;Detailed analyses of the highly populated superfamilies, accounting for two thirds of all known domains, have shown that relatives can diverge considerably to acquire modified structures and functions. We also find interesting examples of convergent evolution within a superfamily where different catalytic machineries are associated with similar enzymatic chemistries, showing that these scaffolds enable multiple routes to the same function. Recent sub-classification of CATH superfamilies into functional families has enabled the detection of residues highly implicated in the function and a better understanding of the mechanisms by which functions can shift. This has been illustrated by application to a family of anti-biotic resistance enzymes &ndash; the serine beta lactamases. Functional site detection is also being used to interpret the impacts of missense mutations linked to human disease and to interpret the possible effects of other genetic mechanisms linked to the emergence of new functions eg alternative splicing.</p> <br> DNA based emerging technologies for biological and biomedical applications </br><br><p>Structural DNA nanotechnology explores various nanoscale structural and functional properties of DNA to manipulate matter at nanoscale for diverse applications.1 Three dimensional architectures based on DNA polyhedra have raised particular interest in biomedical applications.2,3 I will present the first successful delivery of quantum dots (QDs) as the internal payload of DNA icosahedra. A long-standing challenge for QDs has been the inability to achieve their monofunctionalization in bulk. We resolve this by encapsulating QDs within molecularly identical icosahedral DNA particles in bulk where the DNA shell is mono-functionalized with different endocytic ligands. We demonstrate the monofunctionalization and successful specific, endocytic uptake of QDs, using multiple endocytic ligands like folic acid, Galectin-3 (Gal3) and Shiga toxin B-subunit (STxB).4 Single particle tracking of Gal3/STxB-bearing, QD-loaded icosahedra using Lattice Light Sheet Microscopy reveal new observations of compartment dynamics along the endocytic pathways. QD-loaded DNA polyhedra bearing ligands of unique stoichiometry represent a new class of high-precision molecular imaging tools for quantitative approaches to complex biological phenomena arising from receptor clustering.5 My results highlight the emerging potential of DNA devices in cell biology and biomedical applications that could enable probing and programming various biological systems as well as developing next generation tools for targeted delivery of molecular payloads within living systems.6</p>

Such abnormalities predispose to reentrant electrical activity in the heart. In the absence of tissue heterogeneity, high-frequency impulse generation can also induce dynamic electrical instabilities leading to reentrant arrhythmias. We studied arrhythmogenesis using in vitro and in silico monolayer models of neonatal rat ventricular tissue with 30% randomly distributed cardiac myofibroblasts and systematically lowered intercellular coupling achieved in vitro through graded knockdown of connexin43 expression. Arrhythmia incidence and complexity increased with decreasing intercellular coupling efficiency. This coincided with the onset of a specialized type of spatially discordant action potential duration alternans characterized by island-like areas of opposite alternans phase, which positively correlated with the degree of connexinx43 knockdown and arrhythmia complexity. At higher myofibroblast densities, more of these islands were formed and reentrant arrhythmias were more easily induced. This is the first study exploring the combinatorial effects of myocardial fibrosis and dynamic electrical instabilities on reentrant arrhythmia initiation and complexity.</p> <br> Logic Driven Science-Endless Conclusions: The Race Towards Elucidating the Physiological Role of Bacterial Phosphotriesterases. </br><br><p>Bacterial Phosphotriesterases (PTEs) have gained prominence due to their involvement in hydrolysis of triester linkage found in organophosphate (OP) insecticides and nerve agents. These PTEs have been classified into three distinct structural groups, viz organophosphate hydrolases (OPH), methyl parathion hydrolase (MPH) and Organophosphate Acid Anhydrolase (OPAA). Among these three PTEs, the OPAA is shown to be a dipeptidase (prolidase). However, quite independent views exist on the physiological role of other two PTEs. One of them proposes evolution of PTEs from their progenitors viz,, lactonases (OPH) and lactamase (MPH), in response to increased concentration of organophosphate insecticide residues in soil. The second view suggests their role in iron/phosphate acquisition and believes that OPs are fortuitous substrates for PTEs. Although the proposed views are based on logic driven science, the conclusions drawn are quite different and suggests unique physiological roles for bacterial PTEs.</p> <br> Molecular mechanisms behind the surprising force adaptation of motors on intracellular vesicles. </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Majority of vesicular motion in cells is bidirectional and is carried out by kinesins and cytoplasmic dynein-1 on MTs. Using lipid droplets(LDs) in Cos1 cells as a model system, we have discovered a load induced (with optical trap) dynamic force adaptation of motors on LDs. Remarkably, force measurements on LDs in vivo and in vitro suggest that, these sub-cellular cargos can &lsquo;sense&rsquo; when they are stuck, and respond by dynamically increasing efficacy of force production. This phenomena is totally unexpected and contradicts the current thinking in the field that the groups of molecular motors function in a stochastic way.</p> <br> Understanding the mechanistic links between the circadian clock and plant metabolism for crop improvement. </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Drought is one of the major challenges affecting crop productivity and yield.&nbsp;Circadian clocks in plants are primary regulators that enable biological processes&nbsp;to synchronize with daily and seasonal variations to allocate resources during the&nbsp;most beneficial times of day and year. This endogenous timekeeper controls a complex genetic network with broad impacts on biological processes of agronomical importance&nbsp;via molecular processes such as gene expression. Various inputs such as light and&nbsp;temperature set the internal oscillator and coordinate output to the appropriate&nbsp;time of the day. Circadian- regulated output pathways, such as growth and stress&nbsp;responses, feedback to modulate clock function. This complex interconnection leads&nbsp;to the functionality of the clock as a central hub in a complex regulatory network.&nbsp;As a consequence, adjustments in clock function in response to environmental&nbsp;variation allow plants to adapt and ensure a sustained increase in yield. Despite&nbsp;having a robust understanding of the genetic functioning of the clock, the&nbsp;mechanistic links between the clock and cellular metabolism are largely unknown.&nbsp;Elucidation of stress signaling networks has previously focused on functional and&nbsp;structural descriptions from transcriptomics and proteomics approaches. However, to&nbsp;make successful and predictable changes to signaling cascades, a full description of&nbsp;the dynamics of fluxes is also essential. Combining the basic understanding of the model plant Arabidopsis with translational approaches in soybean, my research&nbsp;focuses on understanding plant metabolism using a circadian clock lens integrating&nbsp;genomics, biochemistry, molecular genetics, evolutionary considerations, and&nbsp;computational approaches to understand the perception, integration of metabolism<br />signal to clock and how the response, contributes to the overall fitness of the&nbsp;plants during normal and stress conditions. My overarching research interests are to&nbsp;understand the &lsquo;fundamental links&rsquo; of plant metabolism and the circadian clock&nbsp;and provide novel insights towards clock regulation of abiotic stress such as&nbsp;drought. These strategies would overall facilitate improved crop varieties with&nbsp;enhanced energy and nutritional value for agricultural biotechnology purposes.</p> <br> Kinesin: A machine or an animal. A single molecule force spectroscopy approach. </br><br><p>Abstract: The kinesins motor proteins move cellular cargo on microtubule<br />tracks. They are best known for<br />their role in cell division and in axonal transport in neurons. A defect<br />in kinesin function leads to<br />diseases, typically involving defective transport of cell components or<br />pathogens, or defects in cell<br />division.<br />The mechanics of kinesin motor motion has been studied extensively in<br />the last decades. Because<br />of the identical subunits, the motor has been proposed to rotate during<br />stepping. For each step the<br />motor is expected to rotate by 180-degree and a torque transferred from<br />the motor head, through<br />the stalk, onto the motor bound cargo should then be visible as angular<br />steps for every translational<br />step.<br />Yet, experiments mostly done at low ATP concentrations only revealed<br />occasional motor stalk<br />reversals and an asymmetry of consecutive steps, so-called limping,<br />which was attributed to loads<br />perpendicular to the microtubule axis. The stepping rate of kinesin<br />motors is slower at low ATP<br />concentrations and faster at higher ATP concentrations. At high,<br />physiological ATP concentration,<br />rotations have not been detected because of long response times of<br />rotational probes.<br />Recent work on intermediate states during stepping indicate continuous,<br />however, direct evidence<br />for such rotational motion is lacking.&Acirc; Here, we used high-resolution<br />optical tweezers combined with<br />a sensitive optical micro-protractor and torsion balance employing<br />highly birefringent, liquid<br />crystalline probes to directly and simultaneously measure the<br />translocation, rotation, and generation<br />of force and torque of single kinesin-1 motors.<br />Our results and many other interesting experiments from the field prove<br />that single molecule force<br />experiments are indeed going to be a mainstay in any modern biology<br />laboratory. To this end it is<br />essential to develop highly efficient and stable Force spectroscopes<br />which are easy to use and provide<br />a seamless workflow with other biological techniques.<br />I will be discussing my present work with Lumicks BV, towards creating<br />correlative STED optical tweezers<br />and a low cost high throughput acoustic force spectroscope.</p> <br> The Role of Monomethylated Lipids, Arachidonic Acid Derived Lipids, and a Novel Glycolysis- JNK signaling axis in Aging </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">In the first part of the talk, I will describe our work in understanding the role of the essential branched chain amino acids (BCAA) in maintaining skeletal muscle&nbsp;homeostasis. It is known that with aging there is a rapid loss of skeletal muscle mass, and that signals from BCAA can slow this loss. Using Lipidomics and a mouse&nbsp;models of dysfunction in BCAA metabolism we have discovered novel BCAA derived lipids that may play a critical role in muscle repair and regeneration. We have also&nbsp;shown that the common anti-diabetic drug Metformin may have a therapeutic role in diseases of BCAA dysfunction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the second part of the talk, I will briefly describe upon our current work in understanding metabolism of senescent cells. Senescent cells accumulate with aging&nbsp;and environmental damage. They are thought to be important drivers of aging itself and aging related pathologies. We have recently discovered that these cells<br />generate arachidonic acid derived signals that may drive lung fibrosis, and selectively targeting this signaling pathway using small-molecules in mice may&nbsp;improve recovery from lung damage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the final part of the talk, I will speak about a combined proteomics-metabolomics driven approach that uncovered a metabolic switch at the center of&nbsp;JNK-induced proteostasis and longevity.</p> <br> Functional and genetic heterogeneity in the embryonic mammalian heart </br><br><p>The heart is the first organ to form and function during mammalian embryogenesis. It is unusual in having to contract rhythmically whilst still undergoing extensive morphogenetic remodelling. Thus, form and function of the embryonic heart are inextricably linked. In this seminar, I will describe our efforts to characterise how the earliest contractile activity in the heart is triggered and how the various cell types of the early heart are specified, summarised below.</p>
<p>We have recently shown that even prior to displaying overt contractile activity, nascent cardiomyocytes in the mouse embryo show spontaneous asynchronous calcium oscillations, essential not only for triggering the earliest heart beats but also for the proper differentiation of cardiomyocytes. In order to understand when such calcium oscillatory activity arises during embryogenesis and how it comes to be synchronised across the forming heart, we are using light sheet microscopy of cultured embryos from a GCaMP6 reporter mouse line. We have detected calcium oscillations amongst scattered cells at the earliest stages of mesoderm formation, prior to specification of the cardiac lineage. We are using small molecule inhibitors of various calcium channels to tease apart the cellular mechanism for such early calcium activity.</p>
<p>The heart is composed of a variety of cell types of diverse embryonic origins. To understand the developmental trajectories of cells that contribute to the embryonic heart, we have used single cell sequencing to profile approximately 4000 cells from early cardiac crescent to linear heart tube stages. Unbiased clustering and diffusion pseudotime analyses of these data reveal extensive cellular heterogeneity at even the earliest stages of heart development, novel marker genes for cell populations and unexpected cell populations contributing to the heart.</p> <br> Imaging life with the new frontiers in spatial and temporal resolution. </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">"Visualizing and understanding complex biological processes demands the integrated efforts of biologists and physicists. The mission of the Advanced Imaging Center (AIC) is to make cutting-edge imaging technologies developed at Janelia widely accessible, and at no cost, to scientists outside of Janelia, before the instruments are commercially available. Operating strategically at the interface of engineering and biological applications, the AIC is positioned to drastically reduce the time between instrument development and widespread use in the increasingly technology-intensive field of biology. The AIC seeks to expand the number and diversity of biologists who have access to the unique, state-of-the-art optical imaging microscopes developed at Janelia years before they become commercially available. This unique imaging center is thus uniquely positioned to empower investigators with tools currently not widely available elsewhere. In alignment with Janelia's philosophy of encouraging bold and risky science, the AIC welcomes proposals with high-risk-high-gain projects that may challenge the current paradigm. In fact, it serves as an ideal platform for researchers to test out their novel ideas with the emerging microscopy technologies, fully supported by Janelia's in-house imaging experts and research infrastructure."</p> <br> Weak and Transient Interactions have Big Effects for Intracellular Transport  </br><br><p>The cell is a complex machine taking in information, performing computations, and responding to the environment. To enable agile read/write capabilities, much of the molecular biochemistry that performs these computations must be transient and weak, but perhaps numerous and coupled to enable high activity. Traditionally, biochemical interactions that we study in the test tube have examined strongly interacting systems because we perform our experiments in dilute solutions over long times. I will present excerpts from stories where many weak, transient interactions can have strong effects on the overall activity and can, in fact, overpower strongly interacting systems. These studies involve the microtubule cytoskeleton and the transport motor, kinesin-1. These examples will set the stage for proposing to study weak, transient interactions so that we can elucidate their fundamental activities and ultimately learn how to engineer them to create biological or biomimetic devices.</p> <br> Actin retrograde flow actively aligns and orients ligand-engaged integrins in focal adhesions.  </br><br><p>Integrins are transmembrane receptors that, upon activation, bind extracellular ligands and link them to the actin cytoskeleton to mediate cell adhesion and migration. Cytoskeletal forces in migrating cells generated by polymerization or contractility drive &ldquo;retrograde flow&rdquo; of actin from the cell leading edge have been hypothesized to mediate integrin activation for ligand binding. This predicts that these forces should align and orient activated, ligand-bound integrins at the leading edge. Here, polarization-sensitive fluorescence microscopy of GFP-&alpha;Vï¢3 integrins in fibroblasts shows that integrins are co-aligned in a specific orientation within focal adhesions (FAs) in a manner dependent on binding immobilized ligand and a talin-mediated linkage to the actin cytoskeleton. These findings, together with Rosetta modelling, suggest that integrins in FA are co-aligned and may be highly tilted by cytoskeletal forces. Thus, the actin cytoskeleton sculpts an anisotropic molecular scaffold in FAs, and this feature may underlie the ability of migrating cells to sense directional extracellular cues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br> Nanosecond fluctuations as a route to designing ligands for structure-less proteins  </br><br><p>How do we design a drug for an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP), which has no well-defined structure? This an important unsolved challenge in Biophysics, since many incurable diseases are associated with such disordered proteins. Here we suggest that dynamics of spontaneous fluctuations of the disordered protein can be a guide for designing and testing ligands for them. We hypothesize that a molecule which is structurally close to the putative ligand would alter the dynamics, even if binds to the protein only weakly or transiently. We test this hypothesis in Amylin, a peptide associated with type II diabetes. We measure single-molecule fluctuations with ~10ns accuracy using Fluorescence Cross Correlation Spectroscopy (FCCS), by probing changes in Forster Resonance Energy Transfer between the two termini. We find that the distance between the two termini fluctuates with a time scale of about 140 ns. This agrees with the order of magnitude expectation from Statistical Mechanics predictions about such disordered proteins. Interestingly, it falls in the time scale inaccessible to most other techniques, including NMR. We use this fluctuation time scale as a guide for diagnosing interaction of amylin with potential ligands. We propose dynamics-based measurement as a general approach for discovering ligands for IDPs.</p> <br> Photonics in the pursuit of living cell membrane structure and function  </br><br><p>The broad aim of my laboratory is to develop an understanding of how a eukaryotic cell regulates local composition influencing the construction of signaling complexes, and also how it may engage in membrane deformation, thereby influencing global membrane properties, in a regulated fashion. We have taken a multi-disciplinary approach, combining biology with physics and chemistry to address the main theme of our research.</p>
<p>To study the organization of cellular components, we explore the dynamics of fluorescently-tagged molecules in a variety of living cells from the nanometer scale in specialized domains in cell membranes to the micron scale prevalent in mapping endocytic pathways. We have used and developed many microscopy tools suitable for these explorations. Our studies provide a new picture of the cell membrane as an active composite of the lipid bilayer and a dynamic cortical actin layer beneath, wherein, dynamic actin filaments help in controlling the local composition of membranes. In addition the sorting properties and endocytic pathways of a variety of molecules, including membrane proteins, lipids and lipid-tethered proteins in vivo, have led to new insights about endocytic pathways that function at the cell surface. In this lecture I will discuss how we and others have utilized a variety of photonic tools in the pursuit of understanding the dynamic architecture of the living cell membrane and its deformation.</p> <br> Revealing mesoscopic organization and function of the plasma membrane by developing high-speed single-molecule microscopy  </br><br><p>Molecular dynamics in the plasma membrane (PM) is fundamentally important for the molecular functions in the PM, but the mechanisms by which the molecular diffusion in the PM is regulated still remain unresolved. By applying single-particle (40-nm-diameter colloidal gold) tracking at high time resolutions of up to 0.025 ms (a 40-kHz frame rate), we found confined diffusion + hop movements (termed &ldquo;hop diffusion&rdquo;) for both a transmembrane (TM) protein, transferrin receptor, and a non-raft phospholipid, DOPE, which could be well hidden at observation rates slower than hop rates, and are mistakenly judged as simple Brownian diffusion. It turned out that these two molecules sensed the equal compartment sizes in the PMs of five different cell lines examined, PtK2, NRK, T24, HeLa, and HEPA-OVA (actual sizes were cell-dependent and ranging from 45 to 250 nm; Fujiwara et al., 2002, 2016). Electron tomography identified the actin-based membrane skeleton (MSK) right on the PM cytoplasmic surface, and demonstrated that the MSK mesh size was the same as the compartment size for the PM molecular diffusion (Morone et al., 2006; Fujiwara et al., 2016).</p>
<p>These results support the model of the actin-induced mesoscopic compartmentalization of the PM. TM proteins are temporarily corralled due to the collisions of their cytoplasmic domains with the actin-based MSK mesh bound to the PM inner surface, called the &ldquo;MSK fence&rdquo;, and various TM proteins, anchored to and aligned along the MSK, called the &ldquo;anchored TM-protein pickets&rdquo;, create a barrier against the free diffusion of both TM proteins and lipids. Importantly, these pickets not only exert steric hindrance effects but also hydrodynamic friction effects on the surrounding molecules, thus inducing confining effects on membrane molecules.</p>
<p>Recently, we succeeded in developing a new high-sensitive high-speed camera system, which now allows us to image single fluorescent molecules in the PM at a time resolution of 0.1 ms (a 10-kHz frame rate), the fastest ever performed. By employing a much smaller fluorescent probe Cy3, it was found that virtually all TM proteins and lipids undergo hop diffusion in the PM, strongly indicating that our previous data were not affected by the binding of the large colloidal gold particle, but actually reflected the true behavior of TM proteins and lipids in the PM. Thus, we have proposed a paradigm shift for the long-range structure of the PM is required from the fluid mosaic model of Singer and Nicolson to the compartmentalized fluid model. The involvement of the compartmentalized PM in regulating biological functions of the PM, for example, how the membrane domains such as rafts and focal adhesion structures fit into the view of the compartmentalized PM, will be addressed.</p>

Biomembranes, self-assembled from lipid molecules, act as a platform for the assembly of several 2D and 3D biological structures. I will describe our efforts to understand biological assembly on lipid membranes using bacterial pore forming toxins (PFTs) and filamentous bacteriophages. PFTs, a major class of bacterial toxins are released as water soluble monomers. Upon binding the bilayer membrane, they undergo structural rearrangements and oligomerize to form a stable transmembrane pore. The molecular mechanisms giving rise to selective pore formation on target eukaryotic membranes have been unclear. Using single molecule imaging, we dissect the assembly pathway of ClyA, a representative &alpha;PFT and demonstrate how cholesterol is a key component for effective pore formation and a possible means for selective targeting of PFTs to their target cells.</p>
<p>Next, I will discuss the assembly of M13 filamentous phages in bacteria. After infection, phage components use the inner membrane of the bacteria to assemble the coat protein on the phage DNA allowing the phage to be extruded out without rupturing the cell. We visualize M13 assembly on live bacteria using super-resolution microscopy. The assembly kinetics is fast but variable within the bacterial population indicating possible rate limiting steps in phage assembly.</p>

Interestingly, land plants have lost centrosomes and the cytoplasmic dynein motor complex during evolution, which are critical factors that control various microtubule-related activities in animals and fungi. How do plants manage without them? To address this question, our laboratory started a study using the moss Physcomitrella patens as a plant model system. By developing RNAi tools and imaging technology, we gained insights into how microtubules are nucleated and organised without centrosomes.

Assessing their relative/dynamic effects on the evolution of diverse social systems has been a major challenge for researchers. I present aspects of my research that focus on examining the impact of phylogenetic relatedness, group-size&nbsp;and resource-competition, and most recently human impact, on nonhuman primate social&nbsp;structure and/or zoonotic infection risk. In this regard, macaques (genus: Macaca) are an&nbsp;ideal genus, with their similar social organizations and well-established phylogenies, but&nbsp;diverse (despotic-to-tolerant) social styles, geographic ranges, and degrees of overlap&nbsp;with human landscapes. First, I use a comparative approach to reveal that the structure of&nbsp;dominance relationships across macaques show strong phylogenetic signals, i.e. members&nbsp;of the Sulawesi lineage show more shallow hierarchies and less transitivity/certainty in&nbsp;their dominance networks than those of the Arctoides and/or Fascicularis lineages. In&nbsp;contrast, grooming network structure seems more labile to the influence of group-size,&nbsp;with larger groups showing more modular, less dense network connections than smaller&nbsp;groups. Second, I describe contrasting evidence that sociodemographic factors impact&nbsp;within-species differences in macaque sociality. Among free-ranging rhesus macaques,&nbsp;larger group-size and/or intense resource-competition appear to generate greater degrees&nbsp;of despotism, i.e. more asymmetry in dominance and lower rates of post-conflict&nbsp;affiliation. However, among wild Tibetan macaques, larger group-size/severe rangerestriction&nbsp;appeared to lower degrees of despotism, i.e. shallow dominance hierarchies&nbsp;and greater reciprocity in grooming on account of a decreased demand for rank-related&nbsp;benefits such as support in conflicts. Thus some aspects of social behavior maybe linked&nbsp;to ancestry, whereas others are labile to socioecological and/or supply-and-demand&nbsp;biological markets conditions. My current research is implementing the conceptual&nbsp;framework of coupled-natural-and-human-systems to assess the impact of anthropogenic<br />factors on variation in macaque social networks and susceptibility to zoonotic bacterial&nbsp;pathogens. Further, work on captive rhesus macaques is revealing that increased social&nbsp;network connections may either socially buffer individuals from microbial infection risk,<br />or enhance such risk owing to contact-mediated sharing/transmission of microbes. This&nbsp;may depend on pathogen-specific modes of transmission and/or overall social context.<br />This naturally sets the stage for future investigations of the socioecological bases of&nbsp;zoonotic infection/ transmission through networks of free-living primate populations. I&nbsp;end by conceptualization group social structure as social reaction-norms, i.e. where&nbsp;groups may respond similarly to variation in extrinsic factors, but may have inherently&nbsp;different ranges of responses to the same conditions.</p> <br> Contributions of altered axonal lysosome transport to Alzheimerâ€™s disease pathology </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Lysosome-filled axonal swellings are a major, but poorly understood feature of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease amyloid plaques. It is not clear what causes these axonal lysosomes to accumulate at amyloid plaques or whether they contribute to the disease pathology.&nbsp; Our previous characterization of these lysosomes at amyloid plaques led us to propose a model where these axonal lysosomes accumulate due to a local defect in their retrograde transport and maturation and represent pathologically meaningful sites of A&beta; production[1]. To test this hypothesis, we developed mouse genetic strategies to alter axonal lysosome abundance and examine the impact on amyloid plaque pathology. To this end, we identified JNK-interacting protein-3 (JIP3) as a candidate for regulating axonal lysosome abundance and validated such a function through extensive cell biological characterization of JIP3 KO mouse neurons. These efforts revealed that JIP3 is an important regulator of the transport, abundance and maturation state of axonal lysosomes. Furthermore, we observed multiple similarities between the axonal lysosomes that accumulate in JIP3 KO neurons and those that build up around amyloid plaques. This includes a build up of amyloid precursor protein (APP), and its processing enzymes-&beta;-secretase (BACE1) and presenilin 2 (PSEN2). We detected significantly elevated A&beta; levels in the JIP3 KO neurons, consistent with the hypothesis that the build up of the above-mentioned proteins leads to increased processing of APP into A&beta; peptides, in the accumulating axonal lysosomes. Finally, our examination of the in vivo relationship between JIP3-dependent axonal transport of lysosomes and amyloid plaque pathology revealed that loss of JIP3 was accompanied by an increase in soluble A&beta; levels, amyloid plaque size, abundance and axonal dystrophy[2].&nbsp; These results collectively support a model wherein efficient retrograde axonal lysosome transport and maturation acts as a negative regulator of APP processing and the development of amyloid plaque pathology.</p>

Numerous local-in-time models exist for collective motion. Here we study behaviour that seeks to maximise the space of accessible states, out to some future time horizon. We apply this principle to mobile agents that can turn and vary their speed. By exhaustive enumeration of states we show that such &ldquo;future state maximization&rdquo; (FSM) gives rise to a cohesive swarm of agents that is remarkably similar to those seen in animal systems. We discuss why FSM may be more generally connected with intelligent, or &ldquo;fit&rdquo;, behaviour in living systems at all scales. We then study two classes of heuristics that mimic computationally intensive FSM. These could plausibly operate in close to real time under animal cognition [cells might be able to operate similar heuristics]. We show that iterative application of these heuristics as the model for the behaviour of &ldquo;others" when determining the dynamics of &ldquo;self&rdquo; under FSM can lead to closure of the problem. Thus, a real-time heuristic approximating FSM is evolutionarily accessible and appears to be in close agreement with data. Problems in which the behaviour of one agent is dependent on the behaviour of others abound in in nature and successful closure of such problems is generically challenging.</p> <br> Harnessing host immunometabolic circuits to design TB HDTs </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">An effective host immune response is important to control Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) growth, and to contain its latent persistence. Using a chemical genetics approach we have demonstrated that activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) axis, regulator of whole-body energy metabolism, by FDA approved drugs / supplements could control inflammation and Mtb infection. This indicates the deep engagement of Mtb pathogenicity with host cell immunometabolic machinery. We hypothesize that the functional connections between immunity and pathways controlling metabolic signaling could be harnessed to advance the host-directed therapy (HDT) pipeline, leading to the development of clinically relevant anti-TB therapies. We are currently utilizing single cell high-dimensional approaches to (i) understand the dynamics of host-pathogen interaction, and (ii) identify new metabolic regulators that are important during Mtb infection and could have therapeutic implications. The data related to this effort will be presented and discussed.</p> <br> Spatiotemporal regulation of metabolism in embryonic development and cancer </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Metabolism constituted one of the main focal themes for early developmental and cell biologists. However, with the exponential rise in molecular biology, research in basic metabolism came to a standstill. As a result, while the genetic basis of embryonic development and cancer is fairly well established, how intermediary metabolism plays a role in these contexts is not clear. Our results on organogenesis stage mouse embryos revealed the presence of a glycolytic gradient in the embryonic presomitic mesoderm (PSM) tissue. Real time imaging of&nbsp;ex vivo&nbsp;PSM using a pyruvate biosensor showed a spatial and temporal evolution of the glycolytic gradient as cells transit from a posterior PSM to an anterior PSM fate. These results indicate that metabolic state of cells is also an intrinsic feature and it can dictate cellular fate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Prior studies have shown that under nutrient and oxygen deprivation, cancer cells depend on acetate as a nutrient for their growth and survival. However, exactly which metabolic pathways acetate feed into and the relative importance was not known. Our studies using quantitative mass spectrometry show that the enzyme, Acetyl-CoA Synthetase 2 maintain distinct sub-cellular acetyl-coA pools for gene regulation and lipogenesis. Such a spatial compartmentalization helps cells maintain their carbon balance especially under nutrient stress.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the current advent in analytical and imaging technologies that can directly probe metabolism qualitatively and quantitatively, the days of future past in understanding metabolic regulation in health and disease are finally here.</p> <br> Transporting cargo over long distances: insights from Cryo-EM structures of dynein/dynactin </br><br><p>Cells depend on components being moved to the correct place at the correct time. My group is interested in cytoplasmic dynein-1 (dynein), a motor which delivers many different cargos via the microtubule network. When dynein is mutated it leads to neurodegeneration and it is susceptible to hijack by viruses which use it to travel into the cell.&nbsp; In the presence of cargo adaptor proteins, such as BICD, dynein binds a cofactor called dynactin.&nbsp; This generates a transporter complex capable of long distance movement along microtubules.&nbsp; We have used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine a 4.0&Aring; structure of dynactin that explains how this 23 subunit complex is assembled.&nbsp; We subsequently used cryo-EM, in vitro motility assays and in cell assays to determine why dynein is inhibited when it is on its own and how it is activated by binding dynactin.&nbsp; We are now working to understand how the cargo adaptors specifically recruit dynein to dynactin.</p> <br> Adipose tissue expandability, lipotoxicity and the metabolic syndrome </br><br><p>The link between obesity and type 2 diabetes is clear on an epidemiological level, however the mechanism linking these two common disorders is not well defined. One hypothesis linking obesity to type 2 diabetes is the adipose tissue expandability hypothesis. The adipose tissue expandability hypothesis states that a failure in the capacity for adipose tissue expansion, rather than obesity per se is the key factor linking positive energy balance and type 2 diabetes. All individuals possess a maximum capacity for adipose expansion which is determined by both genetic and environmental factors. Once the adipose tissue expansion limit is reached, adipose tissue ceases to store energy efficiently and lipids begin to accumulate in other tissues. Ectopic lipid accumulation in non-adipocyte cells causes lipotoxic insults including insulin resistance, apoptosis and inflammation. This article discusses the links between adipokines, inflammation, adipose tissue expandability and lipotoxicity. Finally, we will discuss how considering the concept of allostasis may enable a better understanding of how diabetes develops and allow the rational design of new anti diabetic treatments.</p> <br> Lipid droplets and innate immunity  </br><br><p>Lipid droplets are various sizes in different cells, and present in essentially every cell in your body. Originally thought of as passive balls of fat, it is now clear that they are a dynamic sub-cellular compartment, involved in both lipid storage and control of lipid metabolism, but also playing a role in diverse other cellular processes including cells response to stress, and also in storing proteins needed elsewhere in the cell. I will discuss our research highlighting their role in innate immunity, and will describe how they sequester and release histones to kill bacteria.</p>
<p></p> <br> Tubulin polyglutamylation - a novel player in neurodegeneration. </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">The microtubule cytoskeleton is playing essential and divergent roles in all eukaryotic cells. Microtubule functions are regulated by a multitude of factors and pathways. An emerging mechanism that directly modulates the microtubule lattice are posttranslational modifications of tubulin. While the modifications of tubulin have been discovered decades ago, functional insight is only recently emerging.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have studied the role of tubulin polyglutamylation, a modification prevalent in neurons, and found that deregulation of this posttranslational modification leads to neurodegeneration. To demonstrate the specificity of this mechanism, we have generated a series of combinatorial knockout mice in which we can specifically induce or avoid degeneration of certain neuron populations in the nervous system. We have further investigated the potential mechanisms of the hyperglutamylation-induced degeneration and found a strong impact on axonal transport. Our data suggest that alternations in polyglutamylation could be a biochemical mechanism linked to a range of neurodegenerative disorders in human.</p> <br> Discovery and Engineering of Enzyme Activities In Pursuit of New Antibiotics </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">New antibiotics are urgently needed to tackle the rising menace of drug-resistant pathogens. At present, the most extensive and convenient resource available is the sequenced genomes of microorganisms. We aim to uncover novel natural products from microbial genomes by using a systematic strategy based on biochemical characterization of enzymes involved in antibiotic biosynthesis, and protein sequence homology to guide the selection of candidate enzymes from previously uncharacterized biosynthetic pathways. In addition to uncovering natural secondary metabolites, we intend to develop libraries of analogs of known antibiotics to facilitate facile activity screening. We are developing new building blocks for rapid diversification of structures, and engineering enzymes for late stage non-natural modifications. The stated research goals are being pursued within the domain of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) antibiotics.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I will discuss the reconstitution and characterization of PaaA, an enzyme which catalyzes an unprecedented reaction en route to the biosynthesis of Pantocin A. Enzymes homologous to PaaA were found to be encoded in diverse operons, which may be leads to discovering new secondary metabolites. I will also present our ongoing efforts toward generating libraries of thiopeptide antibiotics, and carrying out non-natural enzymatic modifications like cyclopropanation on complex scaffolds using enzyme catalysis.</p> <br> A general mechanism for membrane-mediated forces of assembly between proteins: the orderphobic effect </br><br><p>I present a mechanism for a generic, powerful force of assembly and mobility for transmembrane proteins in lipid bilayers. This force is a pre-transition (or pre-melting) effect for the first-order transition between ordered and disordered phases of the membrane. Using the statistical mechanics theory of the hydrophobic effect and large-scale molecular simulation, I show that under certain conditions, a protein embedded in a disordered membrane can stabilize a microscopic order&ndash;disorder interface bearing a finite interfacial stiffness. When two such proteins approach each other, they assemble because assembly reduces the overall interfacial energy. The effect is mediated by proximity to the order&ndash;disorder phase transition and the size and hydrophobic mismatch of the protein. I will also discuss the consequences of the orderphobic effect in competition with membrane elasticity, which can give rise to membrane phenomena such as budding.</p>
<p></p> <br> Mechanical control of nuclear reprogramming & cell-fate decisions </br><br><p>In landmark experiments, exogenous biochemical factors (Yamanaka factors) were shown to induce reprogramming of somatic cells into induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSC) in vitro. However, in vivo, cells undergo trans-differentiation programs in the absence of exogenous factors suggesting that the local tissue micro-environmental signals are sufficient to induce such transitions. Towards this end, I will describe our efforts to engineer microenvironment of single somatic cells and show that nuclear reprogramming can be induced by cell-mechanical constraints, with very high efficiency, and without the need for exogenous factors. The mechanical reprogramming of somatic cells and their cell-fate decisions have important implications in understanding disease models and in regenerative medicine.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> <br> Structural Dynamics of Biomolecules Captured By Time-resolved Cryo-Electron Microscopy </br><br><p>Structural dynamics of biological macromolecular is crucial to its structure-function relation, hence obtaining high resolution structures of the biomolecules is an essential task. Many biological processes are very fast and reactions take place in the order of milli or microsecond time scales and the ensuing short-lived states of the molecules are difficult to capture. To address this issue, we developed time-resolved (TR) cryo-EM using microfluidic chip to trap short lived intermediates from tens of milliseconds to second time window.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this presentation, I will discuss TR cryo-EM technique along with single particle analysis to visualize transient intermediate structures of translation initiation during protein synthesis.&nbsp;While translation initiation phase of protein synthesis,&nbsp;a small, or 30S, subunit and a large, or 50S, subunit, join together to form a 70S initiation complex (IC) ribosome with the help of initiation factors. We have resolved discrete structural intermediates on the 50S subunit joining and 70S IC formation pathways with a time resolution of tens of milliseconds. Analysis of the data revealed the existence of an intermediate 70S IC that forms within 20 ms of initiating the 50S subunit joining reaction and is converted into an elongation-competent 70S ribosome within 200 ms of initiating the reaction.</p>
<p>The work presented here demonstrates the powerful ability of time-resolved cryo-EM to reveal the structures of transient intermediates on the reaction pathways of biomolecular machines as they execute some of the most fundamental processes in all of biology.</p> <br> Presentation on HFSPO: Funding opportunities </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">The Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP) is an international program of research support, funding frontier research on the complex mechanisms of living organisms. Research is funded at all levels of biological complexity from biomolecules to the interactions between organisms. The HFSP provides research grant funding support, post-doctoral researcher support and Career Development awards for starting up labs as independent investigators. There will be a presentation on HFSPO funding opportunities, by Dr. Barbara Pauly, Director of Fellowships, HFSPO.</p> <br> Evolution and Genetics of Adaptation: A Case of Spectacular Mimetic Butterflies </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Diversity is the cornerstone of life on earth. Hyper-diverse tropical clades such as mimetic butterflies profusely illustrate this diversity with thousands of species as well as remarkable polymorphic and sex-limited variations. How and why is this diversity generated, and what molecular and developmental mechanisms regulate its evolution? These are interesting problems that scale across the spectrum of biology. I will show with our recent work how diversifying selection, ecological filters and social interactions influence the evolution and diversification of mimicry in tropical butterflies. Sexual and natural selection acting on mimetic phenotypes differentially affect the evolution of colour patterns in the two sexes and on various wing surfaces. This diversifying morphological evolution is controlled at the molecular genetic level by single switch loci of major effect, such as transcription factors and supergenes, and by widespread rewiring and co-option of typically embryonic developmental genes and networks. Overall, our work on adaptation and biodiversity provides an integrative view of biology at the interface of community ecology, evolutionary biology, developmental genetics, and genomics.</p> <br> Lung Regulatory T cells in Inflammation and tolerance </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Airborne pathogens and environmental stimuli evoke immune responses in the lung. It is critical to health that these responses are controlled to prevent tissue damage and the compromise of organ function. Resolution of inflammation is a dynamic process that is coordinated by cellular and biochemical mechanisms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the lung can control excess inflammation via the secretion of TGF-b and IL-10. Here, we discuss our findings that implicate an important role for Tregs in the induction of tolerance to environmental allergens and how the establishment of tolerance can be breached by early exposure to viral infection. Repeated infection with&nbsp;Respiratory Syncytial Virus of infant mice tolerized to ovalbumin (OVA) through their mother's milk induced allergic airway disease in response to OVA, including airway inflammation, hyper-reactivity and higher OVA-specific IgE, as compared to uninfected tolerized control mice. Inflammation in the virus infected mice indicated compromised suppressive function of Tregs. The analysis of Tregs documented a proinflammatory phenotype with the acquisition of type 2 transcription factor, GATA-3 and secretion of type 2 cytokines, IL-13 and IL-5. These findings highlight a mechanism by which viral infection targets a host-protective mechanism in early life resulting in increased susceptibility to allergic disease.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to counter-regulatory cells, one of the biochemical mechanisms to temper inflammation involve specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs). SPMs are a family of endogenous molecules that are enzymatically derived from essential fatty acids that are produced during tissue inflammation and carry potent anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving actions. It has been documented that airway mucosal levels of the essential fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are reduced in human asthma implicating a role for these novel molecules in resolving inflammation. We have identified a critical role for the DHA-derived SPM, Maresin 1 in promoting the de novo generation of Tregs. Exogenous administration of Maresin 1potently regulated type 2 immune responses from CD4 Th2 cells and Innate lymphoid cells (type 2; ILC2) during lung inflammation, in part via&nbsp;de novo&nbsp;generation of Tregs. Our finding also unraveled an important role for Tregs in controlling cytokine production from ILC2 in addition to their established suppressive function of CD4 Th2 cells. Together, these findings have uncovered novel molecular, cellular and immunological mechanisms that regulate Treg generation and function.</p> <br> Building a machine for secretion of bulky collagens from endoplasmic reticulum </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Secreted collagens compose 25% of our dry body weight and necessary for&nbsp;tissue organization, and skin and bone formation. But how are these&nbsp;bulky cargoes that are too big to fit into a conventional COPII vesicle&nbsp;exported from the ER? Our discovery of TANGO1 (Bard,Nature 2006;&nbsp;Saito,Cell 2009; Saito, MolBiol Cell 2011; Santos, J Cell Biol 2016;&nbsp;Malhotra, Ann Rev Cell Dev Biol 2019), a ubiquitously expressed,&nbsp;ER-exit-site-resident, transmembrane protein has made the pathway of&nbsp;collagen secretion amenable to molecular analysis. TANGO1 acts as a&nbsp;scaffold to connect collagens in the lumen to COPII coats on the&nbsp;cytoplasmic side of ER. However, the growth of the collagen containing&nbsp;mega transport carrier is not simply by accretion of a larger COPII coated patch of ER membrane, but instead by rapid addition of premade<br />small vesicles. This mode of transport carrier formation is fundamentally different from that used to produce small COPII vesicles.&nbsp;We have seen that TANGO1rings the ER exit site and thus organizies a&nbsp;subcompartment within the ER (Nogueira, eLife 2014; Santos, eLife 2015;&nbsp;Raote, J Cell Biol 2017).We have now mapped all the components that work&nbsp;in concert along with the cargo to assemble TANGO1 into a ring (Raote et&nbsp;al., in review). Mathematical modelling, biochemistry and super&nbsp;resolution microscopy based analyses of this process will be discussed.</p> <br> Chaperone assisted unconventional protein secretion </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">A large number of proteins including pro-inflammatory cytokines and&nbsp;growth factors are secreted without entering the classical ER-to-Golgi&nbsp;pathway. The signals that trigger the release of these proteins vary&nbsp;from inflammation, extracellular generation of free radicals, and&nbsp;hypoxia, so it is unclear whether these proteins follow a common route&nbsp;of secretion. Our identification of GRASP family of protein in&nbsp;unconventional secretion of Acyl-CoA binding protein rekindled an&nbsp;interest in this molecular puzzle ( Kinseth et al., Cell. 2007). Studies&nbsp;on the secretion of unconventionally secreted Acb1 in in yeast has&nbsp;revealed the involvement of GRASP protein (Grh1), a novel cellular&nbsp;compartment called CUPS, and the role of ESCRT proteins, but without the&nbsp;conventional multivesicular body pathway mediated release cargoes by&nbsp;exosomes (Duran et al., JCB. 2010; Bruns et al., JCB. 2011; Cruz et al.,&nbsp;JCB. 2014Curwin et al., Elife., 2016). Another signal sequence lacking&nbsp;cytoplasmic protein, superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), and its mutant form&nbsp;linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is also secreted by yeast<br />upon nutrient starvation in a Grh1, ESCRT-I, -II and -III dependent<br />process. Our analyses reveal that a conserved di-acidic motif (Asp-Glu)&nbsp;in these proteins is necessary for their export. Importantly, secretion&nbsp;of wild-type human SOD1 and the ALS linked mutant in human cells also&nbsp;require the di-acidic residues. Altogether, these findings reveal&nbsp;information encoded within the cytoplasmic proteins required for their&nbsp;unconventional secretion (Cruz et al., JCB. 2017) Our new findings&nbsp;reveal the involvement of specific chaperones in the export of these&nbsp;proteins and I will present how cells, based on a signal-induced change&nbsp;in cytoplasmic physiology, select a small pool of a subset proteins&nbsp;containing di-acidic motif for unconventional secretion.</p> <br> Light matters - gene regulation by visible light in non-phototrophic bacteria (and beyond) </br><br><p>In recent years it became clear that non-phototrophic bacteria can sense low-intensity visible light and transduce such signals into differential gene expression. This includes the induction of stress responses and also the switch betwen different lifestyles, e.g. planctonic state versus biofilm&nbsp;formation or environmental versus pathogenic style. Genome analyses show that receptor proteins for blue and red light are widespread among prokaryotes and fungi (and are also found in insects and mammalians). They contain&nbsp;a limited number of defined modular domains but are involved in different processes. So far, their mode of action is known in a few cases only. This will be presented and discussed in detail for Listeria monocytogenes, an important&nbsp;model organism for facultative intracellular bacterial pathogens.</p> <br> Building Microbial Communities from the Bottom Up (by Prof. Jeff Gore) & Symmetry and geometry in biological active matter (by Prof. Nikta Fakhri) </br><br><p>BUILDING MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES FROM THE BOTTOM UP:</p>
<p>Jeff Gore</p>
<p>Microbes exist in complex, multi-species communities with diverse interactions that play an essential role in both human health as well as the health of the planet. Over the last decade tremendous progress has been made in characterizing these communities, but the lack of experimentally tractable model systems has made it difficult to discern the rules governing microbial community assembly and function. In this talk I will describe our recent experimental efforts to develop a bottom-up approach to understanding the dynamics of these communities. We have begun by quantifying the network of pairwise competitive outcomes among species within a model microbial community. We find that simple assembly rules incorporating just these pairwise competitive outcomes are surprisingly successful in predicting the outcome of multi-species competition in multiple environments as well as within the gut of the worm, indicating that higher-order interactions among species can often be neglected. These results are a first step towards a bottom-up approach of predicting the emergent behavior within complex multi-species communities.</p>
<p>SYMMETRY AND GEOMETRY IN BIOLOGICAL ACTIVE MATTER:</p>
<p>Nikta Fakhri</p>
<p>Biological&nbsp;functions rely on ordered structures and intricately controlled collective&nbsp;dynamics. Such order in living systems is typically established and sustained&nbsp;by continuous dissipation of&nbsp;energy. The emergence of collective patterns of&nbsp;motion is unique to non-equilibrium systems and is a manifestation of dynamic&nbsp;steady states. Mechanical resilience of animal cells is largely&nbsp;controlled by&nbsp;the actomyosin cortex. Dynamic functions require transitions between different&nbsp;steady states of the cortex via biochemical regulation of the cytoskeletal components&nbsp;tuning the&nbsp;mechanics and stresses.&nbsp;At the same&nbsp;time, mechanical stresses can generate shape deformation or cytoplasmic flows,&nbsp;modulating the reaction-diffusion dynamics of biochemical processes&nbsp;inside the&nbsp;cells.&nbsp;In this talk I will describe our&nbsp;recent experimental effort&nbsp;in understanding&nbsp;the general mechanisms of such mechanochemical feedback, underlying the&nbsp;formation of self-organized spatiotemporal patterns both in model actomyosin&nbsp;cortices&nbsp;and in the starfish oocytes.</p> <br> Ecology and functional potential of endophytes of Pseudowintera colorata (horopito) </br><br><p>Pseudowintera&nbsp;commonly known as horopito is a native New Zealand medicinal plant recognized&nbsp;for its antimicrobial properties.&nbsp;This study reports the structure and&nbsp;functional potential of endophytic bacteria and fungi using culture dependent&nbsp;and culture independent&nbsp;approaches. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis&nbsp;(DGGE) and next gen sequencing (Illumina MiSeq) of plants sampled from ten&nbsp;distinct&nbsp;sites across New Zealand revealed that tissue type was the main factor&nbsp;influencing diversity and richness of microbial communities across all&nbsp;group&nbsp;analysed (PERMANOVA,&nbsp;P&lt;0.05).&nbsp;Influence of tissue maturity on the microbial communities was assessed for a&nbsp;subset of three sites.&nbsp;For this subset, interactions of tissue maturity and&nbsp;location influenced microbial communities across all groups except&nbsp;Alphaproteobacteria&nbsp;and total fungi (PERMANOVA,&nbsp;P=0.226,&nbsp;P=0.164&nbsp;respectively). A total of 350 endophytic bacteria and 200 fungi were recovered&nbsp;the surface&nbsp;sterilized tissues of&nbsp;P.&nbsp;colorata. Of the endophytic bacteria tested (n=350), eleven strains were&nbsp;active against the phytopathogenic fungi&nbsp;Neofusicoccum&nbsp;luteum,&nbsp;N. parvum,&nbsp;Neonectria ditissima, and&nbsp;Ilyonectria liriodendri. Four endophytic&nbsp;bacteria showed activity against&nbsp;phytopathogenic bacteria&nbsp;Pectobacterium atrosepticum&nbsp;and&nbsp;P.&nbsp;brasiliensis&nbsp;and opportunistic human pathogens&nbsp;Staphylococcus aureus&nbsp;and&nbsp;Escherichia coli. Of the endophytic fungi tested (n=50), seven isolates&nbsp;showed activity against&nbsp;Candida albicans.&nbsp;In addition, several&nbsp;endophytic bacteria produced siderophores and a few solubilized&nbsp;phosphate&nbsp;in vitro.</p>
<p>The effect of endophytes displaying&nbsp;in&nbsp;vitro activity was examined by reintroduction as a soil drench.&nbsp;Bacillus&nbsp;sp. TP1LA1B and&nbsp;Nocardia&nbsp;sp.&nbsp;TP1BA1B in addition to increasing the&nbsp;shoot height, also significantly increased the shoot, root biomass and the&nbsp;number of internodes of&nbsp;P.&nbsp;colorata&nbsp;seedlings compared to the control (P=0.016,&nbsp;P&nbsp;&lt;0.001,&nbsp;P=0.007 and&nbsp;P&nbsp;&lt;0.001 respectively).</p>
<p>This study is the first to reveal the&nbsp;community structure of endophytic bacteria, Actinobacteria and fungi in&nbsp;P.&nbsp;colorata&nbsp;and is one of the only&nbsp;two studies on native plants in New&nbsp;Zealand. Members of the endomicrobiome displayed&nbsp;in vitro&nbsp;activity as&nbsp;measured by antimicrobial and&nbsp;nutrient mobilisation assays. The endophytes were&nbsp;able to influence host plant growth when applied as soil drenches and some were&nbsp;able to&nbsp;recolonize the host endophytically demonstrating a route from soil to&nbsp;root. This study indicated that&nbsp;P. colorata&nbsp;harbours unique endophytes&nbsp;which have a key role in the ecology of the plant.&nbsp;</p> <br> Large scale de novo structure prediction of protein families using PconsC3 and ProQ3 </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Accurate contact predictions can be used for predicting the structure of&nbsp;proteins. Until recently these methods were limited to very big protein&nbsp;families, decreasing their utility. However, our recent progress by&nbsp;combining direct coupling analysis with machine learning methods in&nbsp;PconsC3 has made it possible to predict accurate contact maps for smaller&nbsp;families. We also present the PconsFold2 pipeline that&nbsp;uses contact predictions from PconsC3, the CONFOLD folding&nbsp;algorithm and model quality estimations to predict<br /> the structure of a protein. We show that the model quality<br /> estimation significantly increases the number of models that&nbsp;reliably can be identified. Finally, we apply PconsFold2 to 6379&nbsp;Pfam families of unknown structure and find that PconsFold2 can, with&nbsp;an estimated&nbsp;90% specificity, predict the structure of up to 558 Pfam&nbsp;families of unknown structure. Out of these 415 have not been&nbsp;reported before.</p> <br> TBA </br><br><p>TBA</p> <br> Candidate gene approaches in cartilage development research </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">The embryonic cartilage template, initially contiguous, is segmented to give rise to most of the appendicular skeletal elements of vertebrates. Within each of these segments, majority of the cartilage is replaced by bone through a process called endochondral ossification while the cartilage on either side of the plane of segmentation remain as cartilage forever. The cartilage that is replaced by bone is referred to as the transient cartilage while the cartilage lining the ends of each of these segments is referred to as the permanent or articular cartilage. Endochondral ossification proceeds through several well characterized steps which are precisely regulated to enable proper development of limb skeleton. The processes of transient cartilage differentiation and endochondral ossification are relatively well understood, as opposed to the process of articular cartilage differentiation. However, one of the less understood aspects of transient cartilage differentiation is the progression of hypertrophy, a process which if dysregulated results in micromelia i.e. small or imperfectly proportioned limbs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Articular cartilage development begins with the formation of a specialized structure called the interzone which is the location of cartilage segmentation. Once the interzone is formed it serves as the source of Wnt ligands to induce articular or joint cartilage fate in the neighboring cells. However, under a variety of embryonic conditions articular cartilage transdifferentiates into transient cartilage. When I started my laboratory there were many unanswered questions regarding articular cartilage differentiation, such as:</p>
<p>1. How is the location of interzone formation decided?</p>
<p>2. What are the factors, other than Wnt ligands, that are important for articular cartilage differentiation?</p>
<p>3. What are the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for maintenance of articular cartilage?</p>
<p>In the last eight years we have adopted a variety of candidate gene approaches to understand many of the molecular processes leading to successful cartilage differentiation. I will describe these approaches and elucidate the molecular mechanism of articular cartilage differentiation that we have so far uncovered.</p> <br> Computational systems biology of epithelial-hybrid-mesenchymal transitions: can theory help understand cancer biology? </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Metastasis causes above 90% of all cancer-related deaths. It is often driven by epithelial cells losing cell-cell adhesion and gaining the mesenchymal traits of migration and invasion &ndash; a process known as Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). EMT and its reverse MET have beenlargely considered as binary; any hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) phenotypes have been tacitly assumed as transient.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our integrated theoretical-experimental work suggests that a hybrid E/M phenotype can be stably maintained by cells, and can be more aggressive than purely epithelial or mesenchymal phenotype. I have developed novel mechanism-based mathematical modelsofintracellular and intercellular signaling networks regulating EMT or MET that predict that cells in a clonal population can attain multiple phenotypes &ndash; epithelial, mesenchymal and hybrid E/M &ndash; due to systems-level emergent behavior of these networks. Moreover, these models predict that hybrid E/M cells are likely to form many more metastases as compared to fully E or fully M cells, and have identified certain &lsquo;phenotypic stability factors&rsquo; that can both stabilize a hybrid E/M phenotype and associate with poor patient outcome. These predictions have been validated experimentally in H1975 lung cancer cells.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Collectively, my work highlights how an iterative crosstalk between mathematical modeling and experiments can both generate novel insights into the dynamics of cellular plasticityand uncover previously unknown accelerators of metastasis.</p> <br> A computer scientist thinks about the brain. </br><br><p style="text-align: left;">Christos Papadimitriou is currently the Donovan Family Professor of Computer Science at Columbia University.

<p style="text-align: left;"></p> <br> Molecular Chaperones and Motors: From Proteostasis to Pathogenesis </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Maintaining protein homeostasis (proteostasis) is essential for a functional proteome.&nbsp;A wide range of extrinsic and intrinsic factors perturb proteostasis, causing protein misfolding, misassembly, and aggregation. This compromises cellular integrity and&nbsp;leads to aging and diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer. At the cellular&nbsp;level, protein aggregation is counteracted by powerful machineries, which comprise&nbsp;cascade of enzymes and chaperones that operate in a coordinated multistep manner&nbsp;to sense, prevent, and/or dispose of misfolded proteins. Although these processes are&nbsp;well-understood for soluble proteins, there is a major gap in our understanding of how&nbsp;cells handle aggregated membrane proteins. Membrane protein biogenesis is initiated&nbsp;in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is a highly complex and error-prone process.&nbsp;The ER quality control mechanism monitors protein folding and when a protein is&nbsp;misfolded, it is either repaired or disposed of via degradative pathways. My work&nbsp;clarifies fundamental cellular quality control pathways on membrane proteostasis.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Using a non-enveloped polyomavirus as a tool, we investigated the interplay of&nbsp;molecular chaperones and motor proteins during virus infection. Specifically, we<br />probed how the polyomavirus SV40 penetrates the ER membrane to reach the cytosol.&nbsp;During entry, the virus reaches the ER from the cell surface and undergoes structural&nbsp;changes to mimic misfolded protein aggregates that often expose hydrophobic&nbsp;epitopes. The restructured, hydrophobic virus exploits molecular motor kinesin-1 to<br />drive the reorganization of ER membrane chaperone B14 to form the virus membrane&nbsp;penetration site, called &lsquo;focus&rsquo;. The focus-localized virus is then extracted from the<br />membrane by a B14-tethered cytosolic disaggregation machinery (B14, Hsc70 and&nbsp;Hsp110), consequently reaching the cytosol. In summary, my results unraveled how&nbsp;a virus exploits host quality control components to cross a biological membrane. We&nbsp;propose that these insights should guide our understanding of how aggregated&nbsp;membrane proteins (instead of a virus) are recognized, sequestered, and degraded&nbsp;from the cell in order to maintain cellular proteostasis.</p> <br> Naturalist-inspired Chemical Ecology:  A Journey in Perspective </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">The past ten years as Principal Investigator have been a journey in perspective. While my research focus has always remained grounded in chemical ecology and neuroethology, the questions have broadened from the details of insect odor object processing to a greater understanding of object recognition from a chemical, biological, technological, and even artistic perspective.&nbsp;&nbsp;This journey has required me to embrace and integrate multiple lines of inquiry to try and understand how animals, and especially insects, can know what things are in the world around them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I will discuss our observations on object recognition, and our naturalist-inspired process of research itself. In the end, I believe that our path of discovery is as valuable as the destinations of inquiry we seek.&nbsp;</p> <br> Epigenetic Repression by PRC2: Visualizing interactions with cofactors JARID2, AEBP2 and dinucleosomes by cryo-EM </br><br><p>The ability to establish and maintain cellular identity is critical for development in multicellular<br />organisms. Central to this process is PRC2 (Polycomb repressive complex 2), a key epigenetic<br />regulator responsible for gene silencing, which methylates histone H3K27 and is stimulated upon<br />recognition of its own catalytic product leading to heterochromatin formation. PRC2 has been<br />shown to be more active on dinucleosomes than H3 tails or mononucleosomes and requires<br />several cofactors to both modulate and regulate its activity. Here we report cryo-EM structures of<br />the full human PRC2 in several functional states, in complex with its cofactors JARID2 and<br />AEBP2. Additionally, we present cryo-EM reconstructions of PRC2 bound to dinucleosomes<br />which illustrate how a single PRC2 interacts with nucleosomal DNA, precisely positioning the<br />H3 tails to recognize a H3K27me3 mark in one nucleosome and is stimulated to modify a<br />neighboring nucleosome. Both cofactors mimic the binding of histone H3 tails. JARID2 is<br />methylated at lysine 116 and stimulates PRC2 through its interaction with EED, while AEBP2<br />interacts with the RBAP48 site mimicking unmodified histone H3. SUZ12 extends through the<br />complex, establishing interactions with all other PRC2 subunits. A SUZ12-AEBP2- JARID2 sub-<br />complex links the EZH2-EED lobe to the SUZ12-RBAP48 lobe stabilizing the full complex. Our<br />structural analysis reveals the differences in the stimulatory effect of JARID2 and AEBP2<br />binding, while highlighting the importance of their synergistic effect on PRC2 activity. The<br />geometry of the PRC2-DNA interactions allows PRC2 to tolerate different dinucleosome<br />geometries due to varying lengths of the linker DNA. Our structures are the first to illustrate how<br />an epigenetic regulator engages with a complex chromatin substrate.</p> <br> Systems approach to cancer, infectious disease, the environment, and education. </br><br><p>Evolution imprints environmental structure onto molecular and cellular interactions within biological systems. Encoded within the architecture and dynamics of these networks are blueprints and programs for organisms to sense and process complex environmental challenges to elicit appropriate adaptive responses. Decoding these networks and constructing predictive models for their operation lays at the heart of solutions for nearly every complex biomedical and environmental problem --from <g class="gr_ gr_13 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="13" data-gr-id="13">tumor</g> recurrence to drug-resistant infections, to resilience of the microbial loop. We have devised a systems biology approach to reverse engineer gene networks from complex outputs generated by a cell in response to systematically administered perturbations. I will describe the evolutionary, experimental and computational foundations of this powerful systems biology approach. I will focus on how we used this approach to identify gene networks within Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) that coordinate a spectrum of <g class="gr_ gr_16 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="16" data-gr-id="16">defense</g> strategies to effectively hide from the immune system and overcome drug treatments. In addition, I will present short vignettes on applications network-based strategy to personalize therapies to glioblastoma patients and characterize determinants of microbial community resilience. Finally, I will speak about an innovative education program to train high school students in embracing systems thinking and cross-disciplinary practice to solve 21st-century problems.</p> <br> Decoding the Notch response </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Notch is the receptor in a highly conserved signalling pathway that is of major importance in many developmental and disease contexts. Despite a relatively simple transduction pathway, the outcomes of Notch activation are extremely diverse. Such diversity is essential for animal development, but the mechanisms responsible remain poorly understood. Furthermore, one consequence is that inappropriate activity of Notch has very different disease implications depending on the tissue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By performing a comprehensive analysis of the direct response to Notch activation in several Drosophila cell-types we have gained insights into the way that Notch executes different processes. Through these studies we were also able to identify specific transcription factors which cooperate with Notch, and its DNA binding partner CSL, to confer cell type specific responses. This has led to the model that co-operating transcription factors in each cell type create local domains of chromatin accessibility, defining a subset of CSL motifs that can be used.&nbsp; In this way, different enhancers are responsive depending on the specific constellation of other factors present.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A second important question is how Notch can generate both a sensitive and accurate response in the absence of any amplification step. &nbsp;To address this, we have performed real-time analysis of CSL dynamics, including single molecule tracking in vivo.&nbsp; In Notch-OFF nuclei, we found that CSL displays highly dynamic behaviour, with only a small proportion of molecules bound to DNA at any one time. In Notch-ON nuclei, CSL becomes highly enriched at target loci, where the molecules have a longer dwell-time.&nbsp; We find that this change in CSL dynamics relies on two different mechanisms that together provide a paradigm for how Notch activity is transduced at target loci, to enable a rapid and sensitive transcriptional response.</p> <br> Phase behaviour of disordered proteins underlying low density and high permeability of liquid organelles </br><br><p>Many intracellular membraneless organelles form via phase separation of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) or regions (IDRs). These include the&nbsp;Caenorhabditis elegans&nbsp;protein LAF-1, which forms P granule-like droplets&nbsp;in vitro. However, the role of protein disorder in phase separation and the macromolecular organization within droplets remain elusive. Here, we utilize a novel technique, ultrafast-scanning fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, to measure the molecular interactions and full coexistence curves (binodals), which quantify the protein concentration within LAF-1 droplets. The binodals of LAF-1 and its IDR display a number of unusual features, including &lsquo;high concentration&rsquo; binodal arms that correspond to remarkably dilute droplets. We find that LAF-1 and other&nbsp;in vitro&nbsp;and intracellular droplets are characterized by an effective mesh size of&nbsp;&sim;3&ndash;8 ?&euro;?nm, which determines the size scale at which droplet pro perties impact molecular diffusion and permeability. These findings reveal how specific IDPs can phase separate to form permeable, low-density (semi-dilute) liquids, whose structural features are likely to strongly impact biological function.</p> <br> Epigenetic Repression by PRC2: Visualizing interactions with cofactors JARID2, AEBP2 and dinucleosomes by cryo-EM  </br><br><p>The ability to establish and maintain cellular identity is critical for development in multicellular organisms.

Our structures are the first to illustrate how an epigenetic regulator engages with a complex chromatin substrate.</p> <br> Landscape of mutational processes and driver mutations in human cancers </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Somatic mutations are one of the major genetic alterations that contribute to the transformation of&nbsp;normal cell into a cancer cell. The rate of somatic mutations appears in great variability across the&nbsp;genome due to chromatin organization, DNA accessibility and replication timing. However, the&nbsp;impact of DNA-binding regulatory proteins, like transcription factors, on mutation rate variability in the local regions of the genome is unknown. In this talk, I will present our recent findings that the&nbsp;rate of somatic mutations in melanomas is highly increased at active transcription factor binding&nbsp;sites and nucleosome embedded DNA, compared to their immediate flanking regions. Further, we&nbsp;show that this increased mutation rate can be explained by the observed decrease in the activity of&nbsp;nucleotide excision repair at the protein-bound DNA sites, and not due to positive selection during tumor evolution. Taken together, this finding has strong implications for understanding mutational&nbsp;and repair processes in human DNA and for the identification of regulatory cancer driver mutations.&nbsp;Further, in the last part of the talk, I will present our current work on the analysis of whole genomes&nbsp;of 2500 patients across 37 cancer types to identify the landscape of coding and non-coding driver&nbsp;alterations, which confer the selective growth advantage to cancer cells.</p> <br> Investigating the role of store-operated calcium entry in neurons: Gene expression and physiological functions. </br><br><p>Calcium is a universal signalling molecule that regulates a variety of cellular processes like fertilization, cell proliferation and gene transcription. Extracellular stimuli act through G-protein coupled receptors to generate the second messenger inositol trisphosphate (IP3) which mediates release of calcium from endoplasmic reticular (ER) stores by binding to the inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R). Such depletion of store calcium triggers calcium re-entry into the cell through a process known as Store-operated calcium signalling (SOCE). SOCE is mediated by the ER calcium sensor STIM and the plasma membrane calcium channel Orai. SOCE is the major source of calcium entry in non-excitable cells and regulates functions such as gene expression. In excitable cells, despite various other modes of calcium entry, SOCE is present and therefore one interesting question is why these excitable cells need this relatively slower mode of Ca2+ entry. Even though some functions for neuronal SOCE have been discovered recently, much remains to be understood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drosophila genome has single genes for the two major molecular players of SOCE - STIM and Orai as well as the IP3R. Neuronal SOCE triggered by the IP3R in Drosophila neurons is essential for flight. However, the cellular functions of SOCE in the nervous system that mediate flight are not understood. After identifying the temporal requirement of SOCE in neurons for flight, a transcriptomic approach was employed to identify genes whose expression is regulated by SOCE. A novel role for one of the SOCE regulated genes, Ral was identified in flight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SOCE is required in specific neuronal domains viz. glutamatergic and dopaminergic neurons for flight. Transcriptomic screens from purified neuronal populations have been performed in an attempt to identify cell type specific role of SOCE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IP3R mediated calcium signalling and SOCE has also been recently shown to modulate pupariation on a nutrient deprived diet. dSet2, a H3K36 methyltransferase was found to be downstream of IP3R in mediating this phenotype.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This thesis, therefore identifies several genes whose expression is regulated by SOCE, directly or indirectly in different types of Drosophila neurons. Furthermore, it identifies physiological roles for a couple of these genes in mediating the SOCE phenotypes.</p> <br> Skin Stem Cells in Silence, Action and Cancer </br><br><p>Skin Stem Cells in Silence, Action and Cancer.</p>

<p>Adult tissue stem cells have the ability to self-renew long term and differentiate into one or more tissues. Many stem cells are used sparingly to replenish cells during normal homeostasis. However, even stem cells that are quiescent must be able to respond quickly to injury in order to fuel rapid tissue regeneration. How stem cells balance self-renewal and differentiation is of fundamental importance to our understanding of normal tissue maintenance and wound repair. Increasing evidence suggests that the regulatory circuitry governing this balancing act is at the root of some types of cancers.</p>
<p>The hair follicle is an excellent model system to understand how stem cells remain quiescent during times of minimal wear and tear, how these cells become mobilized during the cyclical bouts of hair growth and wound-repair, and how the normal process of stem cell activation goes awry in cancer. We&rsquo;ve identified and characterized at a molecular level an importantstem cell nichewithin the hair follicle. We&rsquo;vemapped the chromatin landscape of these stem cells while they reside quiescently in this niche, and elucidated how this changes when the stem cells become activated to proliferate and progress along their lineage to generate short-lived progeny. We&rsquo;ve also shown that when these stem cells are removed from their niche and placed in culture, they undergo marked chromatin remodeling with strong parallels to the mobilization of stem cells for tissue regeneration that is induced during a wound-response. We&rsquo;ve begun to uncover the underlying mechanisms by which stem cells receive external signals from their microenvironment and transmit them to the nucleus to elicit chromatin remodeling to allow stem cells outside their nicheto survive when confronted with new environments.</p>
<p>Hair follicle stem cells are known to be a source of squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), which as a class, are one of the most common and life-threatening cancers world-wide. We&rsquo;ve applied our knowledge of normal hair follicle stem cells to explore the tumor-initiating &lsquo;stem cells&rsquo; of SCCs. Remarkably, within the SSC, these tumor-initiating cells exist in two distinct states, one more quiescent than the other. We&rsquo;ve devised a method to mark, track and transcriptionally profile these two distinct states of SCC stem cells in vivo, within the tumor. Our findings reveal that both populations reside at the tumor-stroma interface, and are rich in integrins. The slower-cycling population is close to the perivasculature, which contains high levels of TGF-&beta;. These stem cells undergo SMAD2-signaling, express EMT markers, break down the basement membrane and invade. They are also resistant to cisplatin chemotherapy. By contrast, the stem cells that don&rsquo;t receive the TGF&beta; signal grow the tumor faster but undergo apoptosis upon cisplatin treatment. Thus, within the developing SCC, heterogeneity due to an ever-changing tumor microenvironment elicits distinct behaviors in its stem cells, both of which contribute to tumor growth and malignancy. Finally, we&rsquo;ve begun to unravel post-translational mechanisms that cancer stem cells use to survive in an ever changing tumor microenvironment. Overall, these data yield new insights into how the chromatin, transcriptional and translational landscapes change during malignancy, and how this impacts the downstream biology of the cancer cells.&nbsp; As we dig deeper into applying our lessons learned from normal stem cell biology, we hope to continue to build upon our understanding of the roots of malignancy and metastasis in this deadly cancer.</p>
<p>Do join us for high tea after the talk.</p> <br> Communicating science through the media: what could possibly go wrong? </br><br><p>Scientists are increasingly encouraged to use media to communicate the outcomes of their research, whether it&rsquo;s through social media, blogging, print, radio or TV, as well as providing an authoritative voice concerning issues of societal concern. This can be an enjoyable and rewarding activity, but brings challenges. There are claims we live in a &lsquo;post-truth&rsquo; society in which emotional responses matter more than careful consideration of evidence, and the way in which some science is portrayed can seem to support this, with the risk that exaggerated stories of the dangers of everyday activities will increase public scepticism. I will also talk about personal experiences, some good and some spectacularly bad, and suggest ways of improving the way that scientific and statistical evidence is discussed and used in the public forum.</p> <br> Embryo Implantation: War in times of Love - Understanding the Maternal Control of Embryo Implantation to Early Placentation </br><br><p>In mammals, pregnancy is initiated by apposition of the embryo on the maternal endometrium and its subsequent invasion in to the endometrial bed to establish placentation. While this is a central event, the molecular mechanisms of embryo implantation are far from clear. Our lab is interested in dissecting the molecular mechanisms involved in endometrial implantation and trophoblast invasion and using human cell lines, mouse and monkeys as model systems; we discovered that the Homeobox gene HOXA10 is central to the process of endometrial receptivity and implantation. We show that embryo implantation is essentially a two-step process where in the first step the receptive endometrium under embryonic signals get transformed to promote embryo apposition, in the second step the transformed endometrium signals the embryo to promote invasion.&nbsp; These results in long term will have implications in devising rational management strategies for infertility disorders and improve success rates of assisted reproduction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <br> Quantitative maps of organellar Calcium in living systems </br><br><p>I will describe only our recent unpublished work related to a new reporter technology pioneered by my lab that can quantitatively map chemical messengers in sub-cellular organelles in vivo. The framework for this new technology was developed right here on campus, where we initially showed that DNA could measure pH in endocytic organelles without interfering with, or being interfered with, the cell's own networks of DNA control (1). Since 2014, we have significantly expanded this framework to spatially map chemical and physical stimuli such as reactive species, enzymatic cleavage events and voltage in newer organelles such as the ER, the Golgi and phagosome. I will discuss how quantitative chemical imaging affords new insights into physiological processes because we can now pinpoint regulators of enzyme activity in situ in vivo (2). Given the great interest in Calcium signaling on campus, I will also describe our unpublished work on a new way to quantitatively map calcium in organelles, in real time, in a genetic model organism. Hopefully my talk will reveal that DNA nanodevices can be a powerful scaffold to craft precision reagents that can tease apart complex signaling events in living systems (3).&nbsp;</p>

However, their limited success in cross-docking studies is attributed to many factors including a lack of protein flexibility incorporation and the potential role of active site water molecules that do not directly mediate receptor-ligand interactions.&nbsp; In this context, we have investigated ensemble approaches to improving pose-prediction efficiency in cross-docking situations, using CDK-2 Kinase as an example.&nbsp; Furthermore, we have examined the impact of near-active site water molecules on the enrichment of CDK-2 actives in protein structures from high resolution X-ray complexes. Our studies have successfully identified interesting protein modeling methods to generate ensembles suitable for pose prediction enrichment.&nbsp; Also, we find that active site water molecules could potentially influence enrichment of actives in screening studies.</p> <br> Biochemical and single molecule studies of backbone branched RNAs and lariat debranching enzyme (Dbr1p) </br><br><p>The lariat RNA intron generated during pre-mRNA splicing includes a branch-point adenosine that has a 2'-5' <g class="gr_ gr_14 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="14" data-gr-id="14">phosohodiester</g> linkage. This 2'-5' backbone branch in the lariat RNA is specifically cleaved or debranched by the lariat debranching enzyme (Dbr1p).

Our initial bulk lifetime studies suggest that these cbRNAs have two different populations both in the presence and absence of Dbr1p.

 <br> The Evolution of Looking and Seeing: New Insights from Colorful Jumping Spiders </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Insects and spiders face an important challenge: their lifestyles often rely heavily on vision and yet their small size imposes&nbsp;severe spatial constraints on their visual systems.

To address this question, we developed an experimental pipeline that involves deep<br />mutagenesis, computational design, high-throughput gene synthesis, and functional complementation<br />in vivo to comprehensively examine the nature of pressures on amino acid positions. For both SH3<br />domain mediated signaling in S. cerevisiae and a metabolic enzyme in E. coli, the data show that<br />constraints are hierarchically spread throughout the protein sequence and best described by the<br />conserved coevolution of amino acid positions in the respective protein families. Remarkably, the<br />constraints are organized in a two-phase architecture &ndash; a highly cooperative internal network<br />surrounded by a weakly coupled environment. These findings support a simplifying general model for<br />the design of natural proteins, with implications for the underlying physics and evolutionary process.</p> <br> Communicating science through the media: what could possibly go wrong? </br><br><p>Scientists are increasingly encouraged to use media to communicate the outcomes of their research, whether it&rsquo;s through social media, blogging, print, radio or TV, as well as providing an authoritative voice concerning issues of societal concern. This can be an enjoyable and rewarding activity, but brings challenges. There are claims we live in a &lsquo;post-truth&rsquo; society in which emotional responses matter more than careful consideration of evidence, and the way in which some science is portrayed can seem to support this, with the risk that exaggerated stories of the dangers of everyday activities will increase public scepticism. I will also talk about personal experiences, some good and some spectacularly bad, and suggest ways of improving the way that scientific and statistical evidence is discussed and used in the public forum.</p> <br> Regulation of store-operated Ca2+ entry by septins </br><br><p>Ca2+ is an important intracellular second messenger that regulates a variety of cellular processes in both excitable and non-excitable cells. Extracellular Ca2+ can be taken up into cells by a variety of mechanisms. One such involves a class of Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane (PM), which open in response to depletion of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores (Prakriya and Lewis, 2015). Three molecules, namely the inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R), Stromal interaction molecule (STIM) and Orai play essential roles in this process referred to as &lsquo;Store-operated Ca2+-entry&rsquo; (SOCE). IP3R is a Ca2+ channel present on the ER-membrane that opens on binding to its ligand, IP3 and allow Ca2+-release from the ER-lumen to the cytosol. STIM is a ER-membrane resident Ca2+-sensor that senses the drop in ER-Ca2+ levels and translocates to regions of the ER, in close proximity to the PM, the ER-PM junctions, where it physically interacts with the PM-resident Ca2+ channel, Orai, thereby opening it and allowing extracellular Ca2+-entry. The role of STIM and Orai in SOCE is conserved between vertebrates and invertebrates. While STIM and Orai together constitute the basic functional unit of SOCE, additional proteins can regulate their function thereby controlling the level of Ca2+ entry obtained during SOCE. Septins are a class of filament-forming GTPases that assemble into higher-order structures which primarily function as diffusion barriers and adaptors in various cellular contexts (Mostowy and Cossart, 2012). In my thesis, I have investigated the role of septins in regulation of Ca2+-entry through Orai channels in neurons in Drosophila melanogaster. Using genetic manipulations and imaging of Ca2+-responses from primary neurons, I found that Drosophila Septin7 (dSEPT7, also called &lsquo;Pnut&rsquo;) acts as a &lsquo;molecular brake&rsquo; on Orai-mediated Ca2+ entry in neurons (Deb et al., 2016). In my thesis presentation, I will discuss the experiments leading to the identification of dSEPT7 as a regulator of neuronal SOCE, in vivo and subsequent work that provides a mechanistic insight into the mode of regulation of Orai by dSEPT7. I will also present data that suggest a functional divergence among septins of different subgroups in regulation of Orai function in neurons. Lastly, I will present some preliminary results from investigations in a human non-excitable cell-line, HeLa, which suggest a conserved role for human Septin7 in regulation of Orai function in human cells.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> <br> Early nervous system development: Gene networks and cell movement </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">In the embryonic nervous system, gene expression and morphogenesis are intrinsically connected.&nbsp; Given the complexity of their interplay, our approach has been to explore these two aspects of embryogenesis separately in the chick embryo. Our long term goal is to understand gene expression control in neural tube differentiationand cell signaling during lens placode morphogenesis. Early neural differentiation during embryogenesisrelies strongly on the expression of transcription factors.&nbsp; Neural transcription factors often act through reciprocal inhibition, creating a gene network cascade. SCRATCH2 (SCRT2) is a highly conserved member of the Snail superfamily of neural transcription factors that modulates bHLH transcriptional activity. Thus, SCRT2 might be an integral component of the neural differentiation gene network, by modulating and being modulated by other transcription factors.In the first half of my talk, I will present our advances in placing SCRT2 in this network through identification ofthe regulatory elements that control the expression levels of SCRATCH2in its genomic and 3&acute;UTR regions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;In the second half of the talk, I will focus on the lens placode as a model system for morphogenesis. Cell-shape changesin the placodal region display several similarities with that of the neural tube and other organs. Thus, identification of the underlying cellular mechanisms contributes towards our understanding of organogenesis in general. I will show our recent Cell Biology findings of periplacodal cell behavior prior to and during lens placode invagination.</p> <br> Deciphering the Epigenetic Code of Brain Development and Function </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Cell-fate specification during mammalian development involves stable resetting of transcriptional programs and the role of chromatin-mediated regulation in this process has been increasingly appreciated. The nervous system is the most complex organ in all mammalian organisms. The last decade has observed extensive research in understanding how this complexity is generated during neuronal development. Despite exciting progress, very little is known about the function of epigenetic mechanisms in neurogenesis and neuronal activity. Using epigenetics, genomics and molecular biology tools in combination with extensive computational biology approaches we are investigating i) the crosstalk of transcription factors with chromatin during specification of neuronal fate, ii) dynamics of chromatin accessibility during neurogenesis and iii) the function of novel epigenetic regulators during neuronal development. In addition, we are also investigating whether neuronal- activity-dependent gene regulation involves epigenetic reprogramming.</p> <br> A computer scientist thinks about the brain. </br><br><p>Christos Papadimitriou is currently the Donovan Family Professor of Computer Science at Columbia University.

In the case of cancer, we began by exploiting up-regulation of the folate receptor on cancers of the ovary, lung, kidney, endometrium and breast to target imaging and therapeutic agents to these cancers. Clinical trials of six folate-linked drugs demonstrate that the ligand-targeting strategy holds promise for increasing drug potency while reducing unwanted toxicity. Data on treatment of tumor-bearing mice, dogs, and humans will be presented.</p>
<p>We have also developed low-molecular-weight targeting ligands to deliver attached drugs selectively to cancers that over-express tumor-specific receptors. Imaging and therapeutic studies suggest that these targeting ligands improve the diagnosis of cancers and enhance treatment of these malignant diseases. Recent preclinical and/or clinical data on these new targeting ligands con rm this anticipation.</p>
<p>These cancer-specific ligands have also been exploited to &ldquo;light up&rdquo; cancer tissues with tumor-targeted fluorescent dyes during surgeries. is revolutionary technology is now enabling surgeons to nd and remove far more cancer nodules than was ever previously possible. Videos of several of these surgeries will be presented.</p>
<p>Finally, ligand-targeted imaging and therapeutic agents are being developed for a number of autoimmune, inflammatory, and infectious diseases (e.g. malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, atherosclerosis,&nbsp;osteoarthritis, etc.). New exciting clinical and preclinical data on their remarkable efficacies will also be described.</p> <br> Using science for effective conservation actions </br><br><p>Large conservation groups spend several billions of US dollars on conservation each year, which begs the question of how effectively that money is spent. &nbsp;It isn&rsquo;t easy to answer that question, but one thing is certain, scientists often play a minor role, and no large organisation has dared to scrutinise whether their expenditures are effective. I will argue that science must and can play a decisive role in shaping conservation actions. I will examine &nbsp;which species are at risk of extinction and where they occur. &nbsp;Very broadly, threatened species are of two kinds &mdash; large-bodied species distributed sparsely over huge geographical ranges and those with small geographical ranges so vulnerable to habitat loss. &nbsp;For the former, think of tigers and the problems of human-wildlife conflict they create. &nbsp;For the latter, think of the exceptional concentrations of small-ranged species in the Western Ghats and Northeast India. &nbsp;I will concentrate on these. &nbsp;Detailed mapping of species ranges shows that many survive only in small, isolated fragments of remaining habitat. &nbsp;Much good science shows that such isolated populations become extinct quickly. &nbsp;A cost-effective solution can be to restore habitat connections and I will present several examples of such projects.</p> <br> 3D ants and next-generation phenomics - how new imaging technologies change the role of morphology in 21st century entomology </br><br><p>Recent advances in modern computational and microscopic technology have opened new possibilities for interactive and three-dimensional (3D) imagery, such as magnetic resonance imaging, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and especially micro x-ray computed tomography (micro-CT). Micro-CT has the potential to transform comparative and functional morphology research by enabling non-invasive, high-resolution, detailed 3D analyses of morphological structures and the digitization of tissues, organs, or whole specimens. Micro-CT scanning datasets are used to generate virtual models of specimens that can be visualized and variedly manipulated in 3D down to nanometre resolution. These virtual 3D reconstructions can be rotated, sectioned, dissected, and measured to gain comprehensive knowledge of the anatomy and morphology of the specimens studied. Such unprecedented wealth of morphological data and new ways to analyse it open up new possibilities to strengthen the role of morphology in comparative and evolutionary zoology. An increasing number of studies in invertebrate zoology have successfully employed 3D datasets for the reconstruction of fossils, functional and comparative morphology, forensic entomology, and recently taxonomy. However, despite its great potential for a multitude of morphological applications, until very recently the use of micro-CT was rather limited in entomology. In this talk, I want to give an overview of recently published or on-going projects employing micro-CT for different aspects of systematic and evolutionary biology, and highlight both, opportunities and challenges of the new technology.</p>
<p>I will demonstrate that micro-CT is an excellent non-invasive tool for the virtual examination, manipulation, and dissection of (often rare and valuable) material in order to evaluate and discover morphological and anatomical characters within a phylogenetic or evolutionary framework on the basis of on-going projects with ants as focal organisms. Through the application of micro-CT, we are now able to reconstruct a full 3D atlas of ant anatomy, which greatly enhances our understanding of the skeletomuscular system and underlying biomechanics responsible for the ecological dominance and evolutionary success story of ants.</p>
<p>The last two decades have seen the unprecedented advent and rise of molecular phylogenetics, which has greatly improved our understanding of molecular evolution. However, the study of organismal shape and form has remained rather slow and presently suffers from a significant gap of scalability between morphological and genomic data. Micro-CT offers the opportunity to quickly generate comparatively large datasets of 3D surface models that can be analyzed with comparative phylogenetic methods. I will present first data of how 3D geometric morphometrics can be used on micro-CT-generated 3D surface models to study how ant morphology has evolved through time, and investigating both the drivers and consequences of that evolutionary change.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I will show how micro-CT can be successfully applied to visually enhance insect taxonomy by adding new types of 3D contents and I will discuss the concept of virtual cybertypes, which provide detailed and as complete as possible virtual reconstructions of the morphology and anatomy of physical type material. Cybertypes have the potential to greatly change collections-based research in general and taxonomy in particular.</p> <br> Studying primary inherited cardiomyopathies at multiple levels of organization </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Abstract :</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The heart muscle possesses an incredible ability to tolerate and adapt to pathological insults to maintain its contractile function. However, the long-term response to more severe insults is a maladaptive remodelling process characterized by hypertrophy and/or dilation. Single point mutations in any one of the genes encoding the fundamental sarcomeric proteins have been found to cause both hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Among those are 30 mutations in TPM1, the gene encoding &alpha;-tropomyosin, the central regulator of calcium-dependent contraction. Although some of the TPM1 mutants have been extensively characterized, a detailed understanding is not available for all these mutations. The first part of my talk includes the study to determine the molecular mechanisms by which some of the less-characterized TPM1 mutations dysregulate sarcomeric function. For this a basic regulated sarcomere (myosin, actin, troponin, tropomyosin) was reconstituted in vitro to look at the effect of these mutations on biochemical properties including the stability of tropomyosin dimers, binding affinity to actin, conformational changes of regulated thin filaments, ATPase activity of the regulated sarcomere and its sensitivity to calcium. While the results were consistent with the hypothesis that HCMs are hypersensitive to Ca2+ activation and DCMs are hyposensitive, there was heterogeneity in the mechanisms leading up to this binary paradigm.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next, to study how these in vitro changes in contractile function caused by mutations lead to disease at the whole organism level, a humanized b-MHC mouse model was developed. The major isoform of cardiac myosin heavy chain (MHC) expressed in mice is the faster &alpha;- isoform (encoded by the Myh6 gene) whereas in humans it is the slower b- isoform (MYH7). Studies that have compared the same cardiomyopathy mutation in Myh6 versus MYH7, show contrasting effects of the same amino-acid substitutions (Lowey et al., JBC, 2008 &amp; 2013). To overcome these problems we have replaced the coding region of the mouse Myh6 locus with that of human MYH7 locus, including introns and microRNA genes that control MHC expression. The second part of my talk includes characterization of this humanized mouse model, showing that heterozygous humanized mice express human b-MHC at ~50% of total MHC and are functionally similar to wild type mice. The heterozygous humanized mice also develop hypertrophy upon treatment with isoproterenol, a cardiac stressor. As such this mouse could be an improved model for studying cardiomyopathy-causing mutations especially in MYH7.</p> <br> Alternative modes of epithelial polarity </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">The formation and function of epithelial tissues depends on the polarisation of each cell along its apical-basal axis, whereas a loss of this polarity is a hallmark of tumours. Work in&nbsp;<em>Drosophila</em>&nbsp;has identified a conserved set of epithelial polarity factors that define the apical (Crumbs, Stardust, Par-6, aPKC), junctional (Baz/Par3) and basolateral (Scribbled, Discs large, Lgl) domains of epithelial cells, and mutants in any of these genes disrupt polarity and cause epithelial disorganisation. Because these conserved factors mark equivalent domains in invertebrate and vertebrate epithelia, it is generally assumed that this system organises polarity in all epithelia. However, vertebrate epithelia have an inverted arrangement of junctions compared to&nbsp;<em>Drosophila</em>&nbsp;epithelia, with the tight junctions forming apical to the adherens junctions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, knock-outs of several canonical epithelial polarity factors in vertebrates cause tissue-specific phenotypes that are often unrelated to apical-basal polarity. This absence of strong polarity phenotypes has been interpreted as being due to redundancy between closely-related paralogues, but another possibility is that not all epithelia are polarised by the canonical polarity system. This prompted us to ask whether all epithelia are the same in&nbsp;<em>Drosophila</em>, focusing on the adult midgut, which differs from all well-characterised epithelia in being absorptive rather than secretory and endodermal rather than ectodermal. This led us to rediscover that the&nbsp;<em>Drosophila</em>&nbsp;adult midgut has septate junctions (analogous to tight junctions) above the adherens junctions, an arrangement that resembles that in mammals but is inverted with respect to other&nbsp;<em>Drosophila</em>&nbsp;epithelia. Our analysis of polarity in the midgut epithelium reveals that it polarises by a distinct mechanism from other&nbsp;<em>Drosophila</em>&nbsp;epithelia and provides a better model for polarity in many vertebrate epithelia. This diversity of epithelial types in&nbsp;<em>Drosophila</em>&nbsp;may reflect their different developmental origins, or whether they polarise in an apical-basal direction or&nbsp;vice versa,&nbsp;and is likely to be conserved in other animals.</p> <br> Yet to be announced </br><br><p>Yet to be announced</p> <br> Prevention of Heart Attack and Effects of Smoking </br><br><p>Dr. Sanjay Bhat will talk on Prevention of Heart Attack and Effects of Smoking.</p> <br> Genetically Encoded Calcium Indicator to Visualize T cell Ca2+ Dynamics  </br><br><p>Abstract: Calcium is an essential cellular messenger that regulates numerous functions in living organisms. Here, we describe development and characterization of &lsquo;Salsa6f&rsquo;, a fusion of GCaMP6f and tdTomato optimized for cell tracking while monitoring cytosolic Ca2+, and a transgenic Ca2+&nbsp;reporter mouse with Salsa6f targeted to the Rosa26 locus for Cre-dependent expression in specific cell types. The development and function of T cells was unaffected in Cd4-Salsa6f mice. We describe Ca2+&nbsp;signals reported by Salsa6f during T cell receptor activation in naive T cells, helper Th17 T cells and regulatory T cells, and Ca2+&nbsp;signals mediated in T cells by an activator of mechanosensitive Piezo1 channels. Transgenic expression of Salsa6f enables ratiometric imaging of Ca2+&nbsp;signals in complex tissue environments found in vivo. Two-photon imaging of migrating T cells in the steady-state lymph node revealed both cell-wide and localized sub-cellular Ca2+transients (&lsquo;sparkles&rsquo;) as cells migrate. Altogether, our results demonstrate the sensitivity, brightness, uniformity of labelling, and ease of detecting calcium signals in moving T cells using Salsa6f.</p> <br> Translation switches underlying stem cell function and regeneration </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Regeneration is a complex process controlled by highly coordinated spatio-temporal regulation of gene expression. One aspect of gene regulation involves translation control, which is required for precise protein synthesis. My laboratory studies translational regulatory mechanism underlying stem cell function and regeneration.&nbsp; We use planarian <em>Schmidtea mediterranea</em> and mammalian embryonic stem cells as model systems to study stem cell biology and regeneration.&nbsp; Planaria because of their robust regeneration capabilities emerged as a tractable model system to understand mechanisms that drive regeneration.&nbsp; We identified several translation regulators in the stem cells of planaria and demonstrated their important role in regulating stem cell function. The talk will highlight the critical role of polyadenylation and their binding partners such as, cytoplasmic poly (A) binding proteins essential for translation initiation, in stem cell fate decisions. I will also briefly describe our collaborative work on the role of miRNAs, <em>miR-124 family</em>, in regulating brain morphogenesis during planarian regeneration.&nbsp; Most of the translation regulators either directly or indirectly interact with the ribosomes.&nbsp; It has been shown that changing the composition of the ribosomes can modulate the interactions between the ribosome and their interacting partners. Currently, we are using multiple approaches to investigate the changes in the ribosomal composition and its functional relevance for stem cell state transitions. Together, my laboratory extensively studies the translation landscape that control stem cell function and regeneration.</p>

These kinds of efforts, sometimes called 'citizen science' or 'public participation in scientific research', have a long history and track record in several other countries, but are relatively new in India. Citizen Science efforts in NCBS started in 2007, and since then we have worked with over 10,000 people and over 500 schools in gathering information about birds and trees. I will describe this decade-long effort, the progress that has been made, and try and reflect upon what larger lessons we can draw about the opportunities that citizen science provides, as well as important hurdles that must be kept in mind.</p> <br> Rational Design of Domain Swapping in Proteins </br><br><p>This thesis focuses on two different areas of protein folding research, a brief summary of both is provided.</p>
<p>(A) Domain swapping in proteins: Rational design of protein-protein interactions can be used to build supramolecular assemblies capable of performing both biological and bio-inspired functions. A few proteins naturally oligomerize through the process of domain swapping, whereby monomeric proteins self-associate through the exchange of secondary/tertiary structural elements, while retaining their native structure. Engineered domain swapping is a compelling strategy for protein engineering and the design of self-assembling protein complexes. The process of domain swapping is inherently linked to the protein folding problem, because through this mechanism, the same amino acid sequence can fold to more than one well-defined native state (monomeric and oligomeric structures). Although a few promising strategies to coax monomeric proteins to form domain-swapped oligomers have been reported, the factors that encode or modulate domain swapping behaviour in proteins are not fully understood. In this thesis, by carrying out a systematic analysis of the differences that exist between the topologically similar non-domain-swapping (single chain monellin; MNEI) and domain-swapping members of the cystatin/monellin superfamily of proteins, various determinants of domain swapping were identified, which are summarized here.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction of conformational strain by shortening surface loops induces domain swapping in proteins. By designing several different loop deletion variants of MNEI, differing by only a single amino acid residue in the shortened loop, it was shown that the amino acid composition after loop deletion drives domain swapping. (Nandwani, N.*, Surana, P.*, Udgaonkar, J.B., Das, R., and Gosavi, S., 2017, Protein Science).</p>
<p>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A five-residue motif (QVVAG) that drives domain swapping in Stefin B, was engineered in different surface loops of MNEI, resulting in the induction of different modes of domain swapping in MNEI. Factors modulating the QVVAG motif-induced swapping were identified. This work has led to the identification of what might be a general strategy to induce domain swapping in proteins containing &beta;-hairpin motifs. (Nandwani, N., Surana, P., Mascarenhas, N.M., Udgaonkar, J.B., Das, R., and Gosavi, S., submitted)</p>
<p></p>
<p>(B) GroEL-mediated protein folding: An elaborate network of molecular chaperones ensures the integrity of the cellular proteome by assisting in protein folding and controlling protein aggregation. GroEL, a tetradecameric, cavity-containing chaperone from E. coli is the best studied molecular chaperone. In this thesis, GroEL-assisted folding of a well-defined, non-aggregating model protein, the PI3K SH3 domain, was studied. The key results are summarized here.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PI3K SH3 domain was found to fold slowly while remaining bound to GroEL, in an ATP and GroES independent manner. The ability of GroEL (and other chaperones) to fold substrate proteins in the absence of its cofactors is particularly important under stressful conditions resulting in ATP depletion in cells. (Nandwani, N., and Udgaonkar, J.B., &nbsp;manuscript in preparation)</p>
<p>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using thionitrobenzoate (TNB) derivatives of the PI3K SH3 domain, and two other small proteins, it was shown that GroEL can effect the reduction of disulphide bonds, suggesting that GroEL may possess a previously unidentified reducing activity. The apparent reducing action of GroEL could help in its ability to proof-read and edit the three-dimensional structure of client proteins.

<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>The most frequent cause of inherited primary cardiomyopathies (CM) is mutation in the genes encoding sarcomeric proteins. Single point mutations in any of these genes, which include Tropomyosin (Tm) and troponin T (TnT), have been found to cause both hypertrophic (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Tm is a central component of the regulation of muscle contraction and interacts with actin, the troponin complex and myosin. TnT, which is seen as a complex with troponin I and C, interacts with tropomyosin at the N-terminal. Mutations in Tm and TnT account for ~2% and 5% of HCM cases across the globe, respectively. Every day the clinically reported cardiomyopathy cases are at an increase. Till date, 32 Tm linked mutations and 55 TnT linked mutations have been reported which lead to cardiomyopathy.&nbsp; Although some of these Tm and TnT mutants have been extensively characterized, the initial disease mechanisms leading to either HCM or DCM are not clearly understood.</p>
<p>The first part of my talk deals with understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying Tm-related cardiomyopathy, while the second part deals with understanding cardiomyopathy-causing TnT mutations. For each of the parts, a sample of less-characterized and clinically severe HCM and DCM mutations were selected.</p>
<p>The sarcomeric proteins myosin, actin, Tm, and the troponin complex (TnT, TnI, and TnC) were purified and reconstituted in vitro for all functional assays. To understand Tm related CM, changes in actin binding affinity, troponin conformation, calcium sensitivity and myosin ATPase activity were analysed. It was found that HCM mutants are hypersensitive while DCM mutants are hyposensitive to Ca2+, which is consistent with the hypothesis prevalent in the field. These results suggest multiple mechanistic pathways for Tm mutations causing HCM and DCM (Gupte et al. JBC, 2015).</p>
<p>Molecular and computational approaches were utilized to understand TnT-related CM. Microscale thermophoresis (MST) revealed alterations in binding of TnT to Tm. The magnitudes of these alterations remained unaffected by the presence of actin. In ATPase assays, the TnT HCM mutants were hypersensitive while DCM mutants were hyposensitive to Ca2+. Since there is no TnT crystal structure available, computational approaches were used to model the TnT1 domain of TnT, where 65% of pathogenic substitutions reside. The stability predictions made by the model correlated well with the affinity changes observed for the TnT mutants to Tm in vitro. The changes in Ca2+ sensitivity of myosin ATPase activity showed a strong correlation with changes in binding affinity between TnT and Tm. These results suggest that the primary mechanism by which TnT mutations cause cardiomyopathy is by changing the affinity of TnT to Tm within the TnT1 region (Gangadharan et al. PNAS, 2017).</p> <br> Thesis seminar </br><br><p>TBA</p> <br> Mechanisms and Evolution of Search Behavior in Bees </br><br><p>no abstract available</p> <br> Cell chirality drives left-right asymmetric morphogenesis </br><br><p>Most macromolecules found in cells are chiral (an object is chiral if it is distinguishable from its mirror image).&nbsp; However, chirality of cells has not been noticed until very recently. We revealed that cells have intrinsic chirality in their structure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mechanisms of left-right (LR) asymmetric development are evolutionarily diverged and remain elusive in invertebrates.&nbsp; Drosophila has various organs, such as the gut, testes, and male genitalia, which show stereotypic LR asymmetry.&nbsp; Our research focused on the LR asymmetric development of the embryonic gut that is the first organ to show LR asymmetry during Drosophila development.&nbsp; The embryonic hindgut rotates counterclockwise 90 degrees during its LR asymmetric morphogenesis.&nbsp; The active force driving this rotation originates from hindgut epithelium without any contribution of cell proliferation or apoptosis, suggesting that cell-shape change may be contribute to the rotation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our analysis of gut epithelium structure revealed that epithelial cells twist around the apical-basal axis.&nbsp; Therefore, these cells show chirality in their shape, which isdesignated as &ldquo;cell chirality.&rdquo;Our three dimensional vertex modelsuggested that cell chirality drives the LR asymmetric rotation of the gut.&nbsp; Similar cell chirality was found in other fly organs showing LR asymmetry, and its contributions to the LR asymmetric morphogenesis of these organswere similarlyindicated.</p>
<p>We identified Myosin31DF (Myo31DF), encoding Drosophila Myosin ID, as mutants in which LR asymmetry becomes the mirror image of wild-type counterpart.&nbsp; Interestingly, cell chirality also becomes mirror image in these mutants.&nbsp; Our mosaic analyses involving Myo31DF mutant revealed that cell chirality is intrinsically formed in individual cells.&nbsp; Thus, Myosin ID acts as a molecular switch of cell chirality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, cell chirality was reported in various vertebrate cultured cells.&nbsp; Thus, cell chirality may be an evolutionarily conservation mechanismsthat contribute to LR asymmetric development across phyla.</p> <br> Intracellular Parasitism â€“ Survival Strategies of a Cell inside a Cell </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Infection, pathogenesis and inter-host transmission of microbial pathogens depend on their distinct abilities to switch the lifecycle stages and exploit host-cell resources. We are employing three complementary parasitic model protists, <em>Toxoplasma</em>, <em>Eimeria</em> and <em>Plasmodium</em>, which cause toxoplasmosis, diarrhea and malaria, respectively. They allow us to study not only the survival strategies of a eukaryotic cell inside another eukaryotic cell, but also the fascinating biology of their free-living ancestors. One of the major objectives in our group is to elucidate the impact of metabolism and signaling on the reproduction of these intracellular pathogens. Yet another thrust areas of research is to understand the evolution and quintessence of Warburg effect in parasitic protists. Our recent work has also integrated with system biology. Here, we plan to model the metabolism of proliferating cells (microbes and cancer cell) to discern the network design principles of proliferative metabolism in eukaryotic pathogens. Our research intimately blends bottom-up methods of biochemistry, reverse genetics and cell biology with top-down tools of lipidomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics, as well as with prevailing approaches involving optogenetics, high-resolution imaging, CRISPR/Cas9 and network modeling. In this seminar, I will be discussing how differential metabolic designs of intracellular parasites determine their survival and asexual reproduction in varied nutritional environments.</p> <br> The Integrin Network: Role of Integrins in Epithelial Homeostasis and Inflammation </br><br><p>The overarching question that has always fascinated me and driven my research interests is &ldquo;how do cells sense their environment, be it other cells or the extracellular matrix, and respond to it both in homeostatic and perturbed states&rdquo;? To address this, we use the mammalian skin as a model system to functionally interrogate the intricate regulation of cell adhesion, migration, basement membrane organization, stem cell regulation and the immune microenvironment required for the maintenance of epithelial homeostasis, and how these processes go awry in disease states such as cancer.</p>
<p>In this talk, I will present our understanding of how integrins and their associated proteins maintain epithelial homeostasis. Integrins are a large family of heterodimeric trans-membrane receptors that integrate signals between cells and the extracellular matrix. We have been particularly interested in uncovering the functions of integrin beta1, which can partner with 12 of the 18 alpha subunits. The tissue specific KO of integrin beta-1 in the skin epidermis results in mice that are neonatal lethal due to a complete loss in organization of the epithelial basement membrane, and is associated with a loss in specification of epithelial appendages and adult stem cells. Over the past few years we have elucidated the downstream signaling networks that occur in the absence of this important integrin and how this impinges on the phenotype of the KO.</p>
<p>The integrin KO mice display a strong inflammatory and wound response marked by the recruitment of resident immune cells to the basement membrane. Of particular importance is the fact that this wound and immune response is elicited during embryonic development, at a time when there are no extrinsic wounds and no skin microbiome that may facilitate this process. We now understand the very earliest molecular events that set up this sterile inflammatory response, a phenomenon associated with diseases such as arthritis and cancer and have developed tools to mitigate this inflammatory state.</p>
<p>Ongoing and future projects in my lab are focused on understanding the interplay between epithelial and immune cells in homeostasis, wound healing and cancer.</p>
<p>Please join us for tea near LH-1 after the talk.</p> <br> The Anthropocene and the Ecology of Mammalian Populations </br><br><p>Understanding the drivers of species population dynamics has been at the heart of ecological research and debate since the 1920s, with one school of thought advocating endogenous density-dependent factors, while others supporting the exogenous influence of the environment. Exogenous and endogenous processes are expected to express themselves through their impacts on demographic factors that underlie population dynamics; and by analogy, the vital rates that govern spatiotemporal dynamics in species distribution patterns. Importantly, the influence of exogenous processes assumes much significance in light of the continuing evolution of our planet under changing climatic and environmental regimes of the current epoch, the proposed 'Anthropocene'. Through an application of state-of-the-art capture-recapture models to 25 years of monthly trapping data from a fluctuating small mammal population, I will elucidate the synergistic effects of phase, density and climatic variation on demographic processes that underlie multi-annual density fluctuations. The results support the growing view that endogenous and exogenous processes act in tandem to shape the dynamics of fluctuating populations, and that the magnitude and direction of such effects are phase specific. I will thereafter focus on a system involving a wide-ranging, large-bodied endangered mammal that is increasingly faced with the need to compete with people for space and resources, to ask the question: how is the interaction of anthropogenic mortality, and the loss and degradation of habitat, likely to impact the long-term population dynamics of such species? I will answer this question by projecting equilibrium population size with the help of a single-sex, age-structured density dependent matrix population model under scenarios of increasing anthropogenic mortality and loss of wildlife habitat. I will complement the findings of this effort with empirical data on behavioural responses of such species to human-dominated spaces, and suggest that the decisions they need to make in heterogeneous landscapes are far from simple. Not surprisingly, decisions to conserve endangered wide-ranging species in increasingly fragmented, human-dominated landscapes are also complex. The answers, I argue, lie in scientific investigations that draw on ecological theory and exploit methodological advancements that embrace nature in all its complexity.</p> <br> Clinical Regenerative Therapies with Endogenous Stem Cells: A precision medicine approach with Photobiomodulation Therapy </br><br><p>Clinical Regenerative Therapies with Endogenous Stem Cells: A precision medicine approach with Photobiomodulation Therapy</p>

<p><br />Can &lsquo;light&rsquo; be a drug? To satisfy the definition of a drug, the substance must be absorbed and capable of changing bodily function. Light satisfies both criteria and the role of light in human biology is perhaps best exemplified by the visual phototransduction and Vitamin D metabolism. Advances in optics technologies, especially in vivo optical imaging and optogenetics, are spearheading popular biophotonics applications in biology and medicine. Among these, the use of non-ionizing biophotonics treatments in a non-thermal manner to alleviate pain, inflammation, modulate immune responses, promoting wound healing and tissue regeneration is termed Photobiomodulation (PBM) Therapy. Surprisingly, there is a vast volume of scientific literature, both clinical and laboratory studies, documenting phenomenological evidence for this innovative therapy. However, there remain significant inconsistency and non-reproducibility in its clinical outcomes due to the complexity of light-tissue interactions and our lack of mechanistic understanding. Our work has focused on a fundamental understanding of light-biological tissue interactions and utilizing these discrete molecular pathways - in an endogenous optogenetic approach &ndash; to develop rigorous clinical therapies. Among these, a key extracellular mechanism involves activation of a latent growth factor, TGF-&beta;1. Given the tremendous potential and our increasing understanding of stem cell biology, we chose to examine the effect of light-activated TGF-&beta; in promoting directed differentiation of stem cells.1We noted this technique was able to promote lineage-restricted stem cell fates for dentin, bone and cartilage tissue regeneration.2-4 Further investigations on tailoring a suitable microenvironment (using biomaterial scaffold systems) as well as defining clinical dosimetry thresholds (clinical and molecular biomarkers) will be highlighted.5,6 We are cu rrently taking a pharmacological approach in optimizing PBM treatment in these therapies using laboratory data to optimize clinical protocols. Ongoing and future work on a broad range of human applications being pursued including burn wound healing, oral mucositis, Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and traumatic brain injury will be highlighted. Our ultimate goal is to utilize light-evoked, precise molecular pathways to develop safe and efficacious clinical regenerative treatments.7<br />References<br />1. Arany PR.

This fundamental biological event depends on the species-specific interaction between rapidly evolving counterpart molecules on the gametes. We report biochemical, crystallographic, and mutational studies of domain repeats 1-3 of invertebrate egg coat protein VERL and their interaction with cognate sperm protein lysin. VERL repeats fold like the functionally essential N-terminal repeat of mammalian sperm receptor ZP2, whose structure is also described here. Whereas sequence-divergent repeat 1 does not bind lysin, repeat 3 binds it non-species specifically via a high-affinity, largely hydrophobic interface. Due to its intermediate binding affinity,&nbsp;repeat 2 selectively interacts with lysin from the same species. Exposure of a highly positively charged surface of VERL-bound lysin suggests that complex formation both disrupts the organization of egg coat filaments and triggers their electrostatic repulsion, thereby opening a hole for sperm penetration and fusion.</p> <br> Dolna staff training </br><br><p>A training session by the speaker for the below mentioned areas:</p>

<p></p> <br> Hijacking physiological pathways for pathological outcomes </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">A fine balance between cell death and division maintains cellular homeostasis and facilitates organismal survival and growth. Increase in cell death or reduction incell division results in hypocellularity and manifests as global growth defects such as primordial dwarfism or developmental defects of specific organs. On the contrary, an increase in cell division and/or reduction in cell death might result in hypercellularity, as seen in cancers. During normal development, the cell cycle machinery has two important tasks&ndash;to ensure (i) maintenance of genome integrity and (ii) that cell division occurs in a temporally controlled fashion. This is best exemplified in the developing fetalbrain, whereindefective cell division or cell death can lead to impaired brain size and function. Autosomal primary recessive microcephaly (MCPH) is one such neurodevelopmental disorder resulting in reduced brain size at birth. MCPH has been attributed to the loss of functions of atleast 12 different genes, all of which at some point of cell cycle remain associated with the cell division machinery, namely centrosomes.In my talk, I will discussabout my recent findings providing mechanistic insights intothe regulation of cell division by two different MCPH genes and how mutations in them lead to microcephaly. Finally, I will discuss how thesemechanisms essential for normal brain development are hijacked by cancers or by viruses for their survival [1, 2].&nbsp;</p>

<p>Zika virus has emerged as a major health concern over the past year. Its rapid spread across the Americas and link to microcephaly in newborn infants has invigorated efforts to develop antivirals to curb infection in the event of an outbreak. To aid the design of zika specific antivirals, we have determined several high-resolution structures of enzymes central to the life cycle of the virus and used these structures to identify features that lend to structure-based antiviral drug discovery.

It is this question that led us to examine archives, to document the transformation of nature in the city of Bengaluru. One of the areas of interest was to understand how Bengaluru sustained and grew in the absence of a major water source such as a perennial river. Archival sources reveal an interconnected chain of man-made lakes and associated water bodies such as tanks and wells that have contributed to the domestic and agricultural needs of the city since historical times. These lakes were integral to the cultural and social lives of the local communities who managed and preserved the water bodies as urban commons. However, lakes today in Bengaluru make the headlines as polluted, frothing and burning water bodies. How did this transformation come about? Our archival research traces the events and narratives that led to devaluing of local water sources in the city resulting in their conversion and degradation using the examples of specific lakes in Bengaluru.</p>
<p>The task was initially daunting, as we were not trained historians. We were also faced with other mundane challenges: everyday difficulties of finding what was held in the repositories, and of accessing these archives and files. Several years on, our treasure hunt for archival material continues to be a rewarding experience. Through the process of collecting archival material, by analyzing the data and incorporating a historical perspective into our research and outreach, we hope to engage meaningfully with contemporary challenges of Indian cities today, by engaging with different stakeholders. There needs to be a recognition that the water problems of Bengaluru, both flooding and water scarcity that impact city&rsquo;s resilience, stem from a disregard for the historical ecological landscape of the city. Sustainability relates to the endurance of ecological systems, and an understanding of the inter-linked social and ecological histories is imperative in building sustainable systems for the future.</p>

The native three dimensional structure of a protein is crucial for its function. Starting from a disordered unfolded state, proteins fold to their biologically active native state via multiple different routes, traversing a funnel shaped free energy landscape. The timescale at which different proteins fold varies from a few microseconds to several hundreds of seconds. In a test tube, much of the loss in conformational heterogeneity and formation of some amount of secondary and tertiary structure has been found to occur within a millisecond of the initiation of the folding reaction. However sub-millisecond events during a protein folding reaction are poorly understood, largely due to the experimental difficulty in accessing such timescales. In the few cases where submillisecond events have been directly monitored using fast-mixing devices (with microsecond time resolution), the use of a single experimental probe has provided limited information about the complexity and inherent heterogeneity of the early events during protein folding. The aim of the current thesis is to understand the sub-millisecond events that occur during a folding reaction using multiple probes in conjunction with state of the art experimental techniques. To this end, a microsecond mixing continuous flow set up with a mixing dead time of 37 &micro;s was built. By combining multiple probes with the custom built continuous-flow mixer, the sub-millisecond folding of single chain monellin (MNEI) was monitored. &nbsp;It was found that the polypeptide chain undergoes several structural rearrangements in the sub-millisecond time regime that prime the protein for the actual folding transition that commences a few milliseconds after the initiation of the folding reaction.</p>
<p>The current thesis also investigated sub-millisecond conformational dynamics that a protein undergoes under equilibrium conditions. Such structural dynamics are important for the function of a protein. In the case of aggregation-prone proteins, like the prion protein, these dynamics might also allow sampling of conformations that might result in aggregation of a protein. Such structural fluctuations are however fast, and cannot be monitored by conventional spectroscopic techniques. Here, the sub-millisecond dynamics of the mouse prion protein, under equilibrium conditions, were explored using the photoinduced electron transfer fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (PET-FCS) methodology. The timescale at which the native state of the mouse prion protein undergoes conformational dynamics was measured experimentally and addition of salt, which is known to promote aggregation of the protein, was shown to enhance these fluctuations. These fluctuations in the native state are believed to have a role to play in the initiation of aggregation of the mouse prion protein.</p>
<p>Overall, the current thesis explored the sub-millisecond dynamics of proteins, both kinetically and at equilibrium, using a suite of probes that allow access to timescales that are not accessible using traditional spectroscopic methodologies.</p>

The genetic information flow from the DNA not only influences its own replication but also determines the abundance and function of mRNAs and proteins, their interactions, and ultimately the phenotype(s). Therefore, alterations in sequence composition of the genetic material influences the phenotypic outcomes of a cell. In this context, continuous repeating sequences, referred as Tandem Repeats (TRs), in the genome constitute an important source of genetic variation. Importantly, TRs in the protein coding regions often result in repetitive stretches of identical amino acids, known as homorepeats. Proteins with amino acid homorepeats have the potential to be detrimental to cells and are often associated with human diseases. Why then are homorepeats prevalent in eukaryotic proteomes? Are these evolutionary errors or innovations? In my talk, I will discuss our findings on how homorepeats act as distinct functional modules that are often retained in stringently regulated proteins and how their presence facilitates rapid exploration of the genotype-phenotype landscape, thereby contributing to fitness.</p> <br> Regulation of replication fork speed: A new first line of genome surveillance </br><br><p>Faithful and complete duplication of the genome relies on precise regulation of DNA replication. Globally, DNA replication is determined by the frequency of replication initiation and the speed of individual forks. While the series of events required for initiation are well understood, it is completely unknown how &ndash; or if at all &ndash; replication fork progression is controlled. Fidelity of DNA replication demands tight coordination between the movement of replication forks and dNTP-generating metabolic pathways. How cells align fork velocity with dNTP biogenesis, whose periodic oscillations are coupled to the cellularredox state, is unknown. We find that replisome composition is highly sensitive to fluctuations of the dNTP-generating ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) and that already a subtle decrease in RNR activity triggers dissociation of TIMELESS, a fork accelerator from the replisome, followed by a fork slowdown. Mechanistically, RNR attenuation elevates signaling competent reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are detected by peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2), a ROS sensor whose thiol-dependent oligomers interact with TIMELESS at replisomes. Elevated ROS disrupt PRDX2 oligomers to smaller subunits that dissociate from chromatin, and through physical interaction enforce TIMELESS displacement form the replisome. Depletion of PRDX2 or inhibition of its oligomerization increases the residence time of TIMELESS at the stressed fork, preventing fork slowdown and causing replication stress. Furthermore, this ROS-induced, PRDX2-mediated, and TIMELESS-executed fork slow down is exploited by cancer cells to enable DNA replication under elevated metabolic stress. Together, these findings uncover a fundamental physiological mechanism to instantly and reversibly adjust fork speed to metabolic fluctuations in the nuclear milieu and thereby limit replication-borne DNA lesions.</p> <br> Spike timing Precision and Reliability  </br><br><p>Its a TCM talk</p> <br> The Mechanics of Cell Surface Clusters and Their Role in Signalling </br><br><p>The surface of eukaryotic cells is a site for cargo transport, sensing of the extracellular environment, and many diverse signalling processes that transduce extracelluar information into intracellular responses. To accomodate all of these functions, proteins at the surface are organised at several spatial and temporal scales. The mechanisms behind this organisation, and their role in biological processes, are not well understood. In this thesis, I study the contribution of non-equilibrium processes in generating functional clusters of proteins and lipids, through a combination of tools from soft active matter, stochastic processes, and data analysis.</p>
<p>In this thesis seminar, I will place the work into context, outline the contents of the thesis, and go on to describe in detail two projects:<br />(i) The emergent dynamics of actomyosin structures in the cortex<br />(ii) The role of clustering in immune discrimination by T-cells</p>

Yet, fission or the splitting of a membrane compartment is a central theme in biology that manifests during cell division, synaptic transmission, vesicular transportand organelle biogenesis. Fission involves the local application of curvature stress to constrict a membrane tube. Since this topological transformation requires the bilayer to deviate from its preferred planar configuration, membrane fission is an energetically unfavourable process. Using a facile and robust membrane assay developed in the lab, we have elucidated the functional basis for specific proteins that catalyse this process. My talk will describe these recent developments.</p> <br> Regulation of Cytogenesis in Development and Regeneration </br><br><p>To restore physiological health, depleted cells and damaged tissues by surgical removal, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy must be properly regenerated. Although they are essential to human biology and health, the molecular and cellular mechanisms driving the restoration of cell populations and tissues lost to physiological turnover and/or injury remain largely unexplored.</p>
<p>Planarians are free-living flatworms, capable of rapidly regenerating from almost any injury. As an animal species with extremely long lifespan, planarians possess pluripotent adult stem cells capable of unlimited production of all cell types in vivo. Thus far, planarians have become powerful research organisms to study the molecular mechanisms of pluripotency, cell repopulation, and tissue regeneration. First, I will talk about a central role for EGF signaling during stem cell repopulation in vivo. This study provided the first evidence that planarian stem cells undergo both symmetric and asymmetric cell divisions. Disruption of EGF signaling shifted the balance of stem cell divisions towards symmetric divisions, inhibiting expansion and repopulation. Second, I will present the evidence when the repopulation potency of neoblasts are acquired during embryonic development. In the end, I will show the progress in developing methodologies for culturing planarian pluripotent adult stem cells and expressing exogenous genes in vitro. In inStem, with collaboration with Dr. Palakodeti and Dr. Vemula, we will take advantage of both liposome and cell culture systems to generate transgenic planarians. These technical advances will provide new opportunities to advance detailed mechanistic studies of adult stem cell pluripotency and tissue regeneration.</p> <br> Novel host-parasite interactions involved in Plasmodium falciparum merozoites invasion of human RBCs  </br><br><p>Malaria symptoms and pathology are a direct result of invasion of host erythrocytes by the Plasmodium merozoite, a complex and multi-step process that requires coordinated interactions between host erythrocyte and parasite surface proteins. Although more than 50 surface antigens are expressed on Plasmodium merozoite surface, till date barely seven to ten possible interactions between them and their erythrocyte receptors have been well documented. Here we describe two novel erythrocyte receptors; Intercellular Adhesion molecule 4 (ICAM4) and Cyclophilin B that play an important role in merozoite invasion of human RBCs. We further show that many proteins on the surface of merozoites exists in networks and these networks are crucial for the host-parasite interactions.</p>
<p>To identify host receptor(s) involved in the invasion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis into macrophages, we screened a MtbH37Rv genomic DNA library with human lung cDNA library by bacterial two hybrid approach and identified ICAM-1 as one of the receptor that binds to Mtb antigens. We next looked into the role of ICAM-4, an erythocytic ICAM for its role in the invasion of P. falciparum into human erythrocytes. On similar lines, we identified Cyclophilin B as another human receptor that binds PfRhopH3, a merozoite surface protein. Using protein-protein interaction tools, we further showed that Cyclophilin forms a receptor complex with Basigin and these two receptors interact with PfRhopH3 and PfRh5 on the merozoite surface. A denovo peptide, CDP3 that binds Cyclophilin B blocked the Plasmodium invasion by &gt; 80%, thereby suggesting Cyclophilin B as a novel receptor for the invasion of P. falciparum into RBCs.</p>
<p>Our group is also involved in studying the protein(s) organization on the Plasmodium merozoite surface. In this context, we have recently described a number of protein complexes on merozoite surface and have also developed a strategy to strip the merozoite surface for genome/proteome based vaccine development. In conclusion, the talk will provide insights into the novel strategies that our group have applied to identify novel host-parasite interactions involved in Plasmodium merozoites invasion of human erythrocytes. This may have important implications in designing newer drug/vaccine to combat malaria.</p> <br> Unraveling Adaptation </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Organisms frequently face new, changing or otherwise challenging environments, which are thought to drive a large proportion of evolutionary adaptations. However, different populations and species often respond differentially to the same environmental change, potentially altering their evolutionary trajectories. For instance, some populations flourish in new environments, whereas others go extinct. What factors determine individual and population-level responses, and what are the processes and molecular mechanisms that mediate successful adaptation to new habitats?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the past six years, my group at NCBS has addressed evolutionary constraints acting at three different levels: (1) genetic and genomic features that can limit cellular growth, (2) phenotypic and genetic tradeoffs that may constrain adaptation, and (3) inter-species associations that may either limit or facilitate population growth and establishment. In this talk, I will focus on the first point and discuss our results on the evolutionary implications of codon use, tRNA pools and GC content for bacterial translation and growth. Using these results, we are now beginning to bridge the gap across micro- and macro evolutionary patterns of genome evolution, and synthesize ideas about the evolution of key components of bacterial translation. Next, I will briefly touch upon our work on tradeoffs and inter-species interactions as broader factors governing adaptive evolution. Finally, I will discuss our plans to combine experimental evolution with analyses of natural populations and genomes, to determine the broader processes underlying evolutionary change across different levels of adaptive constraints.</p> <br> A mathematical model of Drosophila hindgut </br><br><p>It has been observed in Drosophila embryo that the hindgut is twisted in the first stage of morphogenesis. Moreover, it was discovered that twisting direction of hindgut is reversed in Myo31DF mutant. However, it is not clear the reason why the hindgut is twisted by which cellular mechanisms. In this study, in order to specify cellular mechanisms which occur the twisting phenomenon, we construct a vertex dynamics model for representing Drosophila&rsquo;s hindgut and give numerical results for predicting cellular mechanisms.</p> <br> Inspiration from a tiny mind: Neural and behavioural mechanisms underlying collision detection and avoidance in an insect </br><br><p>Insects are one of nature&rsquo;s ideal systems for understanding principles of<br />how animals sense and interact with their environment. They possess<br />tractable nervous systems that evoke and control robust, predictable<br />behaviours. Using traditional and advanced recording techniques,<br />researchers can address fundamental questions regarding sensory processing<br />and coordination of motor outputs that underlie adaptive behaviours. Two<br />well-studied neurons in the locust visual system, the Lobula Giant Movement<br />Detector (LGMD) and its postsynaptic partner, the Descending Contralateral<br />Movement Detector (DCMD) respond robustly to complex visual motion and have<br />been implicated in controlling flight steering. I will describe ongoing<br />work from my lab that investigates how this pathway responds to visual<br />object motion. My group has recently found that impairment of motion<br />detection and avoidance behaviour following treatment with a neonicotinoid<br />pesticide provides further insights into the role of the DCMD pathway in<br />evoking escapes. While the previous experiments provide information on<br />fundamental properties of the neural control of natural animal behaviour,<br />they also provide insights into biologically-inspired algorithms that can<br />be adopted for controlling autonomous artificial systems.</p> <br> Structural Studies on Zika and Cancer Targets </br><br><p>We use a variety of structure-function analysis to facilitate drug discovery efforts against oncogenic and viral proteins. For this presentation, I will focus on our work on Zika proteins and certain DNA polymerases that are attractive therapeutic targets.</p>
<p>Zika virus has emerged as a major health concern over the past year. Its rapid spread across the Americas and link to microcephaly in newborn infants has invigorated efforts to develop antivirals to curb infection in the event of an outbreak. To aid the design of zika specific antivirals, we have determined several high-resolution structures of enzymes central to the life cycle of the virus and used these structures to identify features that lend to structure-based antiviral drug discovery. Specifically, we have designed and characterized a chemical scaffold that has the potential to exhibit enhanced selectivity relative to the human methyltransferases.</p>
<p>In parallel, we have identified and characterized inhibitors of DNA Polymerase Theta (Pol&theta;), a Afamily polymerase that is highly expressed in many kinds of tumor tissues. Upregulation of Pol&theta; is associated with poor survival in breast cancer, making it an attractive target for the treatment of BRCA deficient cancers. I will summarize our work (unpublished) on Pol&theta; inhibitors and their potential therapeutic application in synergy with PARP inhibitors, using the concept of synthetic lethality.</p> <br> Stochastic mapping and the analysis of selection </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Probabilistic modeling is a powerful way to study molecular evolution, and many efficient statistical approaches exist in phylogeny to infer the evolutionary process explaining observed sequences. In this context, stochastic mapping is an efficient approach to estimate many features of interest of the process on sites and branches, such as the count of substitutions of a given type. In the context of the evolution of coding sequences, I have adapted this approach to the analysis of selection. This allows a rigorous model based definition dN and dS, and better estimates of selection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Usually, gene sequence compositions change along the phylogenies.&nbsp;These changes biase strongly the usual estimates of election, that do not take this non-stationarity inte consideration. With this new method, it is possible to estimate accurately dN and dS even with changing base composition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another feature biases the estimates of selection. During recombination, biased gene conversion (gBGC) biases fixation probabilities towards GC alleles. This induces a tendency on neutral and non-neutral substitutions towards GC, and is mixed up with actual selection. With stochastic mapping, it is possible to consider exclusively substitutions that are independent of gBGC, and then to estimate accurately selection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"></p> <br> Foldamer-based Structural and Functional Analysis of Amyloid Proteins </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">I will present my work on the design of Foldamer-based ligands to gain insight into the cytotoxic pathways of amyloidogenic proteins using various biophysical and cellular assays.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The conversion of disordered peptides into intractable amyloids via a sequence of intermediate structures is a pathological hallmark of many neurodegenerative and organ-localized diseases. Amyloid &beta; peptide (A&beta;) is one such peptide, whose aggregation is associated with the progression and early-onset of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (AD). Recent studies have decisively demonstrated that the prefibrillar soluble oligomers are the neurotoxic culprits and are associated with the pathology of AD. Among many therapeutic approaches, one is the modulation of native A&beta; into off-pathway structures to attenuate the formation of the neurotoxic A&beta; oligomers. Foldamers have been shown to modulate the structure and toxic functions of amyloid proteins. Foldamers are artificial scaffolds with a well-defined conformation which can be derivatized to project chemically diverse moieties without perturbing their fold. A battery of solution and cellular based techniques was employed to investigate the binding interaction between the foldamers and A&beta;. The study presents new pathways to alter the structure and modulate the downstream toxic functions of A&beta;. These approaches will aid in developing potential therapeutic ligands for the treatment of AD.</p> <br> Samose talk: Irrational numbers and Fourier analysis </br><br><p>Consider any irrational number, e.g. the square root of 2=1.414...=a.&nbsp; Now consider the sequence of numbers a,2a,3a,4a,5a,...=1.414...,2. 828...,4.242..., 5.656..., 7.071....&nbsp; Now consider only the fractional part, i.e. strip off the integer part of each to get a number between 0 and 1, and we obtain the sequence .414..., .828...,.242...,.656..., .071... , which we can call b,2b,3b,4b, etc.</p>
<p><br />Claim: this sequence of numbers b,2b, 3b, ... is "equidistributed" between 0 and 1, which means that if we consider, say, a subinterval like (.6,.7), then one tenth of the numbers in this sequence will lie in this interval, because the length of (.6,.7) is one tenth of the length of the whole interval (0,1). &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />This is a straightforward and, I hope, plausible statement.&nbsp; But see if you can prove it with your bare hands--it's not obvious!&nbsp; For comparison, if you instead look at the fractional part of *powers* of an irrational number, i.e. c,c^2,c^3,c^4, the analogous statement is false.</p>
<p><br />In this talk, I will explain how to prove this result using a remarkable argument by Hermann Weyl, which puts the numbers of this sequence in the complex plane by considering the sequence e^ib,e^(2ib),e^(3ib),...&nbsp; This will allow us to apply Fourier analysis, but all we actually need is the statement that Fourier series exist, so we may view it as a black box!&nbsp; All that is needed to understand the argument is familiarity with complex exponentials.</p>
<p><br />This lecture is an apertif for an irregular series of lectures I'll be giving at NCBS on and around complex numbers,&nbsp;Fourier analysis and symmetry.&nbsp; These are rich sources of ideas for many models and problems that, on the surface, have nothing to do with complex numbers, but can often be transformed into an easier to solve problem by using tools that aren't available in the original statement. The goal is to recognize the kinds of situations in which this kind of analysis may be fruitfully deployed.</p>
<p><br />Warm up exercise: what happens above if you take a to be a rational number instead?&nbsp; Take a=3/7, say.&nbsp; And what can you say about e^ia, e^2ia, e^3ia, ...?</p> <br> Building the brain: Role of Transcription factors and chromatin regulators </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">The cerebral cortex is the seat of sensory perception, decision-making, language, learning and memory. For a functional cerebral cortex in adulthood, a diverse number of neurons and glia are to be produced adequately during development. Chromatin level regulations play a very crucial role in the fate specification of neurons and glia. Several neurodevelopmental disorders stem from mutations or perturbations to the process of chromatin regulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yet our molecular understanding of these mechanismsis very poor in the developing brain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To elucidate such mechanisms, I looked at the downstream targets of transcription factor (TF) Lhx2,that has distinct roles in the two regions of the cerebral cortex namely neocortex and hippocampus. In my talk I will describehow this TF along with its association with chromatin modifiers, regulates its target genes to specify a particular class of corticalneurons, which project to the spinal cord and are involved in movement, in the neocortex. Whereas, in the hippocampus, Lhx2 along with 3 other TFs participates in a complex regulatory network to ensure proper numbers of neurons and glia.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Further I will discuss how studying the global genome wide occupancy profiles of TFs and chromatin remodelers will help us understand the fine tuning of gene expression and shed light intothe dynamicity of brain development.</p> <br> Effect of magnesium in riboswitch regulated gene expression </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Riboswitches, a class of non-coding RNA elements located in the&nbsp;untranslated 5' stretch of certain bacterial messenger RNAs (mRNA), have&nbsp;recently been recognized as important players in controlling bacterial&nbsp;gene expression. The control is often exerted via the level of cellular&nbsp;metabolites that self-regulate their production, binding directly to a&nbsp;riboswitch motif on the mRNA that encodes enzymes involved in their&nbsp;biosynthesis. While gene expression regulation by riboswitches is&nbsp;wide-spread in bacteria, they are sparsely found in human. Due to their&nbsp;abundance in bacteria and sophistication of small molecule sensing&nbsp;strategies, in recent times, riboswitch represents promising drug target&nbsp;for antibiotics. Molecular biology, therefore, seeks to understand and&nbsp;expand this amazing sensing ability of riboswitches, in accord with their&nbsp;structural and functional responses under different environmental&nbsp;conditions. Positively charged metal ion environment is essential to&nbsp;maintain the structural fold and thus functions of RNA. Among different&nbsp;metal ions, magnesium is particularly important for the stability of RNA&nbsp;because it can efficiently support a close assembly of negatively charged&nbsp;phosphate groups in an RNA fold. Here, I will present my postdoctoral&nbsp;research which aims to develop a structure-based generalized electrostatic&nbsp;model of RNA, integrated with the essential effects of RNA ion-atmosphere&nbsp;including counter-ion condensation phenomenon. This model has spurred new&nbsp;possibilities encouraging us to deal with substantially large length-scale&nbsp;and long-time scale processes those are associated with complex riboswitch&nbsp;responses, both in the presence and absence of metabolite under different&nbsp;buffer conditions. In this spirit, I&rsquo;ll discuss how magnesium&nbsp;ion-atmosphere pre-organizes a non-coding RNA triplex that facilitates&nbsp;stable metabolite-binding which, in turn, regulates the translation&nbsp;initiation process. I will also discuss how one can control transcription&nbsp;ON-OFF switching in bacteria by tuning the ion-atmosphere of RNA. All the&nbsp;studies tie together state-of-the-art enhanced sampling molecular&nbsp;simulations with our newly developed potential and different biochemical&nbsp;experiments.</p> <br> Archives Public Lecture Series: The Conception and Birth of the Indian Institute of Science: Learning From an Archival Record </br><br><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Archives at the National Centre for Biological Sciences</strong></p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:</p>
<p>The Indian Institute of Science (IISc) is 109 years old. Conceived in 1896 by Jamsetji Tata, IISc was formally born on May 27, 1909. The 13-year gestation period is a fascinating chapter in the history of institution building in colonial India. This presentation traces the author&rsquo;s amateurish attempt to create an archival record of IISc&rsquo;s past and to examine if the historical record contains any clues that explain the remarkable resilience of an institution that has emerged, after a turbulent century, as one of the country&rsquo;s pre-eminent centres for science and engineering.</p> <br> MARS 3D spectral imaging: a novel approach to an old problem </br><br><p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>A challenge for many biomedical researchers is being able to quickly and easily identify targets within tissue. Commonly, histology and microscopy have been used, however, there are significant limitations to these techniques and importantly, they are not suitable for larger scale applications i.e.&nbsp; a whole small animal. Recent advances in photon counting spectral CT mean that the MARS spectral scanner with its iterative reconstruction and processing algorithms can produce quantitative molecular imaging. In both 2D slices and 3D images, materials such as lipid, calcium and water can be identified and quantified at &micro;g/&micro;L levels along with a range of traditional contrast agents (iodine, gadolinium, nanogold). Current preclinical applications of this technology include: developing non-functionalized gold nanoparticles for measuring angiogenesis; functionalized gold nanoparticles for drug delivery in ovarian cancer; imaging of carotid plaque tissue to identify the lipid core, areas of calcification and ulceration; visualization of titanium scaffolds for bone growth; and biomarkers of cartilage and joint health. This non-destructive imaging platform provides preclinical researchers with a tool to further investigate small animal models of disease and analyze human tissue samples.</p>

We have performed micromechanical experiments using an atomic force microscope to study the cell mechanics of E. coli and the failutre of the cell wall with and without the MSC channels.</p>
<p>Mechanosensation is also crucial for many dynamic processes in higher animals. In&nbsp;Drosophila&nbsp;larvae and adults, chordotonal organs (ChOs) are ubiquitous mechanoreceptors, converting a diverse range of physical forces such as sound, vibration and stretch into biological responses. We combine electrophysiological analyses of ChOs in Drosophila larvae with mechanical stimulation, and correlate mechanical properties and active manipulation with neuronal activity. We find that myosin II motors power contraction of the cap cells of ChO and regulate mechanosensation.</p> <br> Hacking the Editorial Process:  A Cell Press perspective into High-impact scientific publishing in the 21st century </br><br><p>Researchers and scientists have faced with more specialized information than ever before, altering the landscape of scientific publishing. &nbsp;Srividya will provide an overview of Cell Press along with a perspective on publishing with Cell Press/ Trends journals, and hacking the editorial process. The discussion will address changing expectations around scholarly communication and open science, including discussion on&nbsp;how Elsevier is striving to go well beyond publishing to enable research communities to filter, curate and assess research output. The session will finally touch upon scientific editing as a career choice, if you are curious about alternatives to a career in academia.</p> <br> Science in organic languages: necessity, challenges and the way forward </br><br><p>Science communication is not new to Karnataka.&nbsp; What is new is the communication of modern science which is largely practiced and discussed in English.&nbsp; Efforts to bring this knowledge into Kannada are more than a century old. The first of the science magazines to be published was in Kannada, exactly 100 years ago.&nbsp; However, the changing times, educational scene, technology and media have brought in changes, both adverse and positive.&nbsp; On the positive side is the accessibility to the origin of new knowledge.&nbsp; Internet, online libraries, online publications have made new research accessible in quick time.&nbsp; However, there is still a great divide between the English literate and other literates in their accessibility of useful knowledge.&nbsp; The digital divide has exasperated the issue further.&nbsp; One of the means to bridge this gap is to increase communication of science in local languages.</p>
<p>There is another gap, the one between the practitioners of science and its beneficiaries, which has more to do with the way the science is done and the world of science is organized.&nbsp; There is a need to bridge this gap too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The talk will focus on some of the efforts practiced in Karnataka on both fronts.</p> <br> Cell-type specificity of septin cytoskeleton â€“ what we learnt from the Sept7 knockout model </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Septins are evolutionarily conserved cytoskeletal proteins with well-established role in cell division, especially in the process of cytokinesis. With the emergence of diverse non-canonical functions ranging from neuronal morphogenesis to antibacterial immunity, septins are gaining prominence as a distinct fourth component of the mammalian cytoskeleton (Mostowy and Cossart 2012; Menon and Gaestel 2017). SEPT7 is the unique member of the mammalian septin family which is a core and irreplaceable&nbsp;component of septin filaments. This vital role is reconfirmed by the early embryonic lethality observed in the Sept7-/- mice and the obligate multinucleation associated with Sept7-deleted fibroblasts (Menon et al. 2014). But interestingly, Sept7 deletion in the hematopoietic compartments does not lead to any developmental defects, despite the co-depletion of the other core septin proteins. Hence, cell-type-specific mechanisms must exist that compensate for the lack of septins in the immune cells. However, the differential role of septins in mammalian cytokinesis could open novel therapeutic windows, where specific targeting of septins could help in anti-tumor therapy with minimum effects on hematopoiesis (Menon and Gaestel 2015). Research using a Sept7-/-&nbsp; fibroblast rescue model could discover the dispensability of the SEPT7-dimerisation in fibroblast division, highlighting SEPT7-SEPT9 or SEPT9-SEPT9 interfaces in the filaments as possible targets for pharmacological intervention (Abbey et al. 2016). While hematopoiesis in general is not affected in the absence of septins, there seems to be a context and stimulus dependent role for septins in the immune response. Future studies aimed at the identification of small molecule modulators of septin cytoskeleton, cell-type specific septin-interactomes and non- canonical septin functions in the immune system will be necessary to fully understand the cell-type specificity of septin functions.</p>

We reasoned that defining transcriptional networks dysregulated in genetic models of disease would inform mechanistic understanding. Therefore, we conducted mRNA and miRNA sequencing of multiple brain regions from F1 crosses of a TauP301S mouse model on three divergent strains, to reduce effects caused by genetic background. Network analysis identified two co-expression modules that were conserved across multiple model systems and in human post-mortem brain from dementia patients. We show that a hub of a putative regulatory miRNA module, miR-203, re-capitulates mRNA co-expression patterns associated with disease state and induces neuronal cell death. We use network modules to identify a probe compound and show that it has the predicted protective effect. Collectively, we identify conserved, disease relevant co-expression networks representing convergent changes in dementia, and miR-203 as a novel regulator of these networks and neurodegeneration.</p> <br> Mechanistic insights into Eukaryotic mRNA 3â€²end processing </br><br><p>Almost all eukaryotic mRNAs have a polyadenosine (polyA) tail at their 3&prime; end that is added co-transcriptionally by a highly conserved multi-protein complex known as the cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF). PolyA tails are essential for mRNA stability, efficient mRNA export into the cytoplasm, and translational initiation. Defects in 3&prime; end processing have been associated with diseases including cancer, thrombophilia and &beta; thalassemia. In spite of having such a fundamental role in the cell, it is not well understood how CPF is structurally organized, how CPF recognizes specific RNA elements and how polyA tail addition is coordinated with other accessory factors. To dissect the molecular mechanism of mRNA 3&prime; end processing, a five-subunit polymerase sub-complex of CPF was identified, recombinantly expressed and purified. The polyA polymerase activity of the recombinant complex could be reconstituted in vitro. Electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) analysis of the complex has resulted in a 3.5 &Aring; resolution structure of Cft1-Pfs2-Yth1 subunits. This structure reveals four &beta; propellers in an arrangement reminiscent of other nucleic acid binding protein complexes involved in DNA damage repair and RNA splicing. The RNA binding zinc finger domains of Yth1 lie adjacent to the putative RNA binding residues of Pfs2, thus providing a composite RNA recognition surface. In vitro assays show that the accessory factor CFIA stimulates the polyA polymerase activity by interacting physically with the polymerase complex and tethering it to the substrate RNA. Together, our data show that the polymerase complex acts as a central hub to bring together the substrate RNA, the polyA polymerase Pap1 and the accessory factor CFIA for specific and effective polyadenylation, to coordinate mRNA 3&prime; end processing.</p> <br> Exploring the Sphere </br><br><p>The&nbsp;Sphere&nbsp;shall be shown in various poses. In some sense, it can be thought of as a polyhedron, a balloon, and the earth itself. Each point of view enables us to study it better. In addition, I hope to present&nbsp; a small application of a way of looking at the Sphere to computer networks.&nbsp;</p> <br> Condensin is a mechanochemical motor that extrudes DNA loops </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Condensin, a ring-shaped pentameric protein complex, plays crucial roles in chromosome organization and compaction, but the mechanistic basis for its functions remains obscure. Using single molecule techniques we demonstrate thatcondensin is a molecular motor that can translocate along DNA and can compact DNA by extruding loops. Condensin-induced loop extrusion was observed to be strictly asymmetric indicating that condensin anchors onto DNA and reels it in from only one side. Our biochemical experiments show that action of condensin on DNA influences the coiling states of DNA substrates and the topological state in turnallosterically control the activities of the condensin complex. The finding that condensin is a mechanochemical motor and a sensor of DNA topology has important implications for understanding the mechanisms of chromosome organization and condensation.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;Srividya Chandramouli is the Chief Editor of Trends in Biochemical Sciences at Cell Press, where she is responsible for planning the overall strategy, leading the execution of the publications plan, and content management of the journal. Before joining Cell Press, Dr. Chandramouli was a postdoctoral research fellow at Whitehead Institute, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) with Dr. Susan Lindquist. She is an active member of Publishers without Borders, a broader initiative to foster the growth of the African continent&rsquo;s scientific community and &nbsp;strengthen the publishing ecosystem by providing&nbsp;skills based volunteering with Elsevier publishers.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dr. Chandramouli received a Ph.D. in Neuroscience from George Mason University, and a M.S. degree in Biological Sciences and Engineering Technology with honors from the Birla Institute of technology and Science, India.She was a Presidential Scholarship Graduate Fellow in in the School of Systems Biology&nbsp; atKrasnow Institute for Advanced Study.&nbsp; While a graduate student and postdoctoral research fellow, Dr. Chandramouli was actively involved in undergraduate teaching. She iscertified by the MIT Kaufman Teaching Certificate Program and has won threegraduate teaching awards.</p> <br> Simulating Enzyme Reactions by QM/MM Methods </br><br><p>Enzymes are outstandingly efficient natural catalysts which carry out the essential chemical reactions at the physiologically relevant timescales.1 They catalyze reactions such as water splitting (Photosystem II), N2 reduction (Nitrogenase), C&ndash;H bond oxidation (Methane Monooxygenase) which are not only necessary for life but also of great importance in sustainable energy and clean environment. Understanding how enzymes &lsquo;work&rsquo; is a fundamentally important problem in biology, which has crucial implications in computational enzyme design. These processes involve the breaking and making of chemical bonds with crucial electron reorganization. Standard classical molecular dynamics methods cannot simulate such processes and it requires quantum mechanical methods. Hybrid Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) methods can analyze enzyme reactions and dynamics in atomic details, beyond that achievable by experiments.</p>
<p>The origin of enzyme catalysis and its mechanisms remain controversial. In view of this, firstly I shall address the question: do dynamics affect the chemical reactions in enzymes?2 Herein I shall discuss the catalytic reaction of Alcohol Dehydrogenase (ADH) to understand the origin of such effects.3 Secondly I shall describe the mechanism of O2 activation and exploration of hitherto unknown intermediates in Salicylate Dioxygenase (SDO).4 Our study provides answers to many fundamental queries by revealing the unprecedented mechanism of O2 activation and the origin of the unexpected regioselectivity in SDO. Finally future research plans will be briefly discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>This presentation will argue that the postcolonial archive must be different from the colonial archive. All archives set up under colonialism collected material about traditions, practices, craft objects, textiles, temple plans, rituals and products of India often with the explicit purpose of reinforcing colonial rule and sometimes with the purpose of generating trade. Historians have been using these archives to write the history of India &ndash; reading the sources against the grain and pointing out the absences and gaps. The postcolonial archives I shall argue here will need to collect different resources and invite new modes of interpretation. Drawing on nearly two decades of engagement with the process of archiving, I shall focus on the challenges faced by archives in postcolonial India where institutions struggle to reinvent their identities. These challenges sometimes originate in the colonial foundations of academic disciplines themselves (a fact that is often forgotten or misremembered) and at other times are instigated by the complex relationship that exists between memory, history and the past. My presentation will use a diverse range of oral histories &ndash; from snake charmers and scroll painters to scientists, anthropologists, museum curators and artists, to show how we can understand the past and make sense of the present.</p> <br> Characterization and perturbation of Darpp-32 in zebrafish </br><br><p>Characterization and Perturbation of Darpp-32 in zebrafish</p>
<p>Animals constantly adapt to their changing environment using sensory-motor adaptation mechanisms. This is achieved by a combination of receptors, sensory organs, neurons and executing muscles. This network is further subject to modulation by neuromodulators, which allows the animal to adapt its responses based on experience and environment. Neuromodulators are molecules that can shape neural circuits and alter intrinsic and synaptic properties of neurons. One mode of action of neuromodulators involves triggering intracellular signaling cascades through G-protein coupled receptors. This results in changes in the phosphorylation state of the neuron, which can affect ionic conductances, receptor levels, transcription etc.</p>
<p>The dopamine and cAMP dependent neuronal phosphoprotein (Darpp-32) is an integrator of GPCR signaling and acts downstream of PKA mediated phosphorylation. Darpp-32 is an unusually potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and maintains the balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation status of key proteins in the cell. We used RT-PCR, in situ hybridization and a custom-made antibody against Darpp-32 to characterize the expression of Darpp-32 over the course of development and in the adult brain of zebrafish. We found that Darpp-32 expression marks specifically principal neurons in the cerebellum and the cerebellum-like structures. These are sensory integrating structures, which are present across vertebrates. While the cerebellum is conserved across vertebrates, the kind of cerebellum-like structure varies across animals. Zebrafish have two cerebellum-like structures, the medial octavolateral nucleus and the optic tectum. We observed, that the onset of expression coincides with the differentiation of these neurons. These findings suggest, that there is a common biochemical signature to the neural circuits of the cerebellum and cerebellum-like structures, which now needs to be explored further.</p>
<p>We then used isoform specific targeted genome editing to generate a Darpp-32 knockout fish. Furthermore, using immunofluorescence staining on the mutant fish we could show that the PP1 &ndash; interaction site containing isoforms of Darpp-32 are expressed in the cerebellum and cerebellum-like structures while the truncated isoform is expressed in the neuroendocrine system.</p>

<p>Insects living on plants are faced with a variety of mechanical problems&nbsp;which can have wide-ranging ecological and evolutionary consequences. I&nbsp;will discuss the role of biomechanics in insect-plant interactions by&nbsp;focusing on how insects attach to plant surfaces, how they are able to&nbsp;run with sticky feet, how plants prevent insect attachment, and how&nbsp;insects overcome such defences.</p> <br> Modulation of Protein Stability and Folding Cooperativity by Cosolvents </br><br><p>Proteins are dynamic molecules and sample a variety of open conformations. Often structural opening events in proteins are transient and hence, are difficult to characterize. Thus, a range of physicochemical perturbants are used to study protein folding, and each perturbant provides important insights into the nature of the protein folding reaction. Some of the perturbants, which are widely used in the protein folding field to reversibly fold/unfold proteins, are cosolvents such as urea, GdnHCl, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), as well as various sugars. It remains an open question in the protein folding field as to how cosolvents affect protein stability and dynamics. Furthermore, it remains to be understood whether cosolvents just facilitate or actively modulate the intrinsic dynamics of the protein.</p>
<p>Recent studies have shown that protein folding has reduced cooperativity. Reduced cooperativity implies that the protein folds via discrete (or continuum of) intermediate states. It is not known whether folding and unfolding of each intermediate state is cooperative (all or none) or gradual in nature. Furthermore, it is not known how protein sequence, stability and (co)solvent conditions affect protein folding cooperativity. Recently, by use of the HX-MS (hydrogen exchange coupled to mass spectrometry) methodology, it has been shown that protein folding cooperativity is strongly coupled to protein stability.</p>
<p>In my thesis work the PI3K SH3 domain was used as a model system. The major findings of this thesis are summarized below.</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Under native-like conditions, the PI3K SH3 domain samples both kinds of structural openings: non-cooperative (gradual) openings as well as cooperative openings. The observation of cooperative unfolding suggests &nbsp;barrier-limited unfolding of the protein</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By measuring the pH dependence of the HX kinetics, it is seen that under the native conditions, the PI3K SH3 domain exchanges in the EX1 regime of HX.</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A linear four state mechanism (N&harr;IN&harr;I2&harr;U) is the simplest kinetic scheme which can explain all the mass distribution data under native conditions.</p>
<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the RT-loop, nSrc-loop, b strands 4 and 5 unfold non-cooperatively, while b strands 1, 2 and 3 unfold cooperatively under native conditions.</p>
<p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PI3K SH3 domain samples the same conformational space in the absence and presence of urea. Urea only decreases the activation energy (barrier height) of unfolding, and it increases the cooperativity of unfolding.</p>
<p>6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The unfolding of b strand 4 changes from being non-cooperative in the absence of urea to being cooperative in the presence of 5 M urea.</p>
<p>7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TMAO induced stabilization decreases protein folding cooperativity.</p>
<p>8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon large stabilization (2 M TMAO), the unfolding of the PI3K SH3 domain completely loses its cooperative nature, and samples the unfolded state in a gradual (diffusive), non-cooperative manner (Jethva and Udgaonkar, 2018a, manuscript under preparation).</p> <br> Structure and function studies of Rieske-Oxygenase like Dehydrogenases </br><br><p>Oxygenases are enzymes that oxidize a substrate<br />using Oxygen<br />from the air.

 double chain monellin </br><br>Protein aggregation is a phenomenon in which monomeric protein undergo
polymerization at various environmental conditions and form higher order
structures, namely amyloid fibrils. Protein aggregation is studied widely
in both disease associated proteins and in the industry related
recombinant protein purification systems. In both industry and research,
protein purification is an inevitable process. During the purification
process, proteins are exposed to different environmental conditions
causing them to misfold which eventually leads to their aggregation. Here
in this study, we looked at the stability of recombinant protein, double
chain monellin (dcMN), at acidic condition using both temperature and
denaturants. At higher temperature or denaturant concentration, the
heterodimeric dcMN separate in to two subunits, chain A and chain B. We
also noticed that in these extreme conditions, this protein have a
tendency to aggregate and form amyloid fibrils. We extended our study to
show that which of the subunit/subunits contribute the aggregation using
purified subunits. We observed that only chain B aggregates in acidic
condition at room temperature. At this condition chain B follows
nucleation dependent polymerization (NDP) kinetics with all four known
characteristics of NDP. The purified chain B process a partial helical
structure compared to the native form present in the dcMN. But on addition
of chain A in to the chain B makes dcMN in a fraction of second. We
studied the non-native aggregation of chain B using both partially
structured purified chain B and structured chain B present in the dcMN. <br> Exploring novel factors and mechanisms regulating pluripotency </br><br>Embryonic stem (ES) cells exhibit characteristic properties of
self-renewal (ability to propagate in culture) and pluripotency (ability
to differentiate to all cell types). The state of pluripotency of ES cells
is established and maintained by interplay of core pluripotency factors
like Oct4, Nanog and Sox2. These core pluripotency factors interact with
various pathways involved in signaling, epigenetic regulation etc. There
is growing evidence of various novel factors forming an extended network
with the core pluripotency factors for fine-tuning and regulating
pluripotency. We are using shRNA based RNAi screen to identify novel
pluripotency factors. shRNA library is being constructed to knock down the
genes, which are expressed exclusively or predominately in mouse ES cells.
The initial RNAi screens using lentiviral shRNAs in ES cells have
identified some novel candidate genes. To understand the role of these
candidate genes in maintenance of pluripotency and development, we are in
the process of deleting these gene loci in mouse ES cells and in mouse
models. We have generated conditionally targeted ES cell clones for
deleting these genes in ES cells. We do not observe any overt phenotypes
in the heterozygous ES cell clones. These heterozygous ES cells are now
being used in targeting experiments to derive conditionally targeted
homozygous ES cells lines. The homozygous deletion of the novel candidate
genes in ES cells will aid in understanding the molecular mechanisms by
which they regulate pluripotency <br> A genetic RNAi Screen for G-Protein coupled receptors involved in
 regulation of flight in drosophila melanogaster </br><br>Calcium (Ca2+) is a versatile signaling molecule that regulates various
cellular processes which in turn modulate many organismal behavior. In
order to achieve this versatility, Ca2+ levels inside the cell are
perceived as signals in many different ways (1). To generate Ca2+ signals,
some extracellular signaling molecules like hormones and neurotransmitters
bind and activate G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) which in turn
activate phospholipase C&#946; (PLC&#946;). PLC&#946; cleaves
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)?to generate inositol
1,4,5-trisphosphate?(IP3). IP3 binds to the IP3 Receptor, a ligand gated
Ca2+ channel on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, creating a surge of
Ca2+ release from the ER (2). IP3 receptor is one of the most important
components of the Ca2+ signaling toolkit.
My goal is to find other important molecules of this Ca2+ signaling
pathway which are required for the initiation of this cascade i.e.
G-protein coupled receptors. It has been shown that reduced levels of IP3R
on pan neuronal (C155GAL4) expression of an itpr transgene dsRNA result in
flight defects (3). Recently it has been shown that silencing the IP3R
using RNAi, in the dopaminergic neurons (TH GAL4), resulted defects in
flight maintenance (S. Sadaf, unpublished data). This suggests that
different sets of neurons are involved in regulation of initiation and
maintenance of flight. It is therefore speculated that different GPCRs may
render such varied phenotypes depending on the neuronal subtype background
under which they act.
I have done a genetic screen for GPCRs that could be important for
regulation of flight in drosophila. 23 GPCRs out of 110 receptors were
found to be involved in regulation of flight. These receptors were
validated for their interaction with IP3 receptor mediated Ca2+ signaling.
Six GPCRs out of 23 were found to regulate flight through IP3 receptor
mediated Ca2+ signaling. These receptors were checked for their
developmental and functional roles during adult. It was found that out of
the six GPCRs identified, four are required during the development of the
flight circuit, and the remaining two are important during neuronal
development as well as adult function of flight circuit. These receptors
are being tested for their sub-neuronal domain specificity for regulation
of flight. This analysis will allow us to identify neurons that are
important for GPCRs driven IP3 mediated Ca2+ signaling that regulates
flight in Drosophila melanogaster.

are subject to stresses like nutrient deprivation, changes in temperature,
pH, etc. They adapt over these stresses by induction of stress specific as
well as general stress responses, the latter conferring resistance to a
multitude of stresses. They can also adapt by accumulating resistance
conferring mutations, and the potential to mutate may be increased by the
various stress responses, for e.g. by induction of error prone
polymerases. With the colossal production and use of antibiotics, bacteria
are now subject to antibiotic stress in a variety of environments and are
rapidly gaining resistance to these. We are looking at emergence of
intrinsic resistance upon exposure to sub-lethal concentration of
antibiotic using E. coli MG1655 as a model. Cells grown at sub-lethal
concentration of kanamycin acquire increased resistance to the same. The
resistance developed is stable and does not decrease immediately after
removal of antibiotic stress. Deep sequencing may be employed to identify
the genomic changes in the strain evolved in the presence of kanamycin. <br>  Tunable reaction kinetics on the cell membrane </br><br><p>Tunable reaction kinetics on the cell membrane: The cell membrane<br />is a complex mixture of lipids and proteins organized into dynamic<br />heterogeneities of a variety of spatial and temporal scales. These<br />heterogeneities are generated by weak interactions between proteins and<br />lipids, passive and active forces due to the underlying Engagement with<br />dynamic cortical actin cytoskeleton, changes in<br />membrane curvature, and other active processes.

evolution of compartmentalized cells
Abstract :
The state of a cell, in terms of its compartments, is determined by the
components of each compartment and the connectivity of compartments, i.e.
through what vesicles is one compartment connected to any other. This is
determined by interactions between components of the vesicle transport
system. Therefore, this interaction network can be looked upon as the
genotype and the compartments a cell has as its phenotype.
What takes us from the genotype to the phenotype of an organism is the
dynamics of its various components, which in this case is vesicle
transport. In this work, we have used an abstract model of the vesicle
transport system. We then look at signatures in the genotype associated
with different kinds of phenotypes. More specifically, we are looking at
how the interaction network of a vesicle transport system needs to evolve
to cause a change in the number of compartments a cell has. <br> Understanding the cellular role of Drosophila Type II PIP Kinase in
 vivo </br><br>Phophoinositides are low abundance lipid molecules implicated in several
cellular signalling cascades that act at spatially distinct locations
within cells. They are thought to regulate processes like growth, membrane
trafficking, cytoskeletal re-organization and ion channel
activation.Phosphoinositides are generated by the phosphorylation of
specific positions on the inositol headgroup of phosphatidylinositol.
Therefore, the enzymes that are involved in the synthesis of
phosphoinositides are critical to the regulation of cellular functions
that they mediate. Once such enzyme is
phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate-4-kinase [PIP4K] that is able to use PI5P
as a substrate to generate PI(4,5)P2. The Drosophila genome contains a
single gene (dPIP4K) encoding PIP4K activity. Loss-of-function mutants in
dPIP4K show defects in larval growth and development and associated
defects in the size of larval cells.? The aim of my project is to
understand the cellular signaling context in which dPIP4K activity is
required to support cell growth. <br> Understanding the dynamics of Wnt signaling in quiescence </br><br>Adult muscle stem cells or satellite cells are quiescent in normal muscle
but enter a proliferative phase in response to muscle injury leading to
repair of damaged muscle fibers. Following the reparative phase, some
satellite cells also return to quiescence to replenish the progenitor
population, allowing further rounds of repair. Thus, quiescence is
emerging as a critical phase in adult stem cell function. Signaling
pathways that regulate induction and/or maintenance of quiescence in
satellite cells are not well understood. Wnt signaling is one of the key
pathways that modulates maintenance and self-renewal of stem cells.
Analysis of quiescence directly in satellite cells is challenging because
of cell activation during the isolation process. Therefore, we use a
culture model in which skeletal muscle myoblasts (C2C12) are reversibly
arrested in G0. Previous reports from our lab showed that quiescent
myoblasts display a strong signature of canonical Wnt signaling. My
studies are aimed at studying the dynamics of Wnt signaling in the
quiescent state. <br> Genetic and Molecular Analysis of dorai, dSTIM and pnut in
Drosophila neurons </br><br>Calcium homeostasis is one of the critical processes for survival of the
cell and it is maintained by components of Calcium tool kit (ITPR, dorai
and dSTIM etc). Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the store house of calcium
in the cell. When concentration of calcium decreases in the ER, dSTIM
senses the decrease and starts aggregating to activate dorai through which
calcium enters in the cell. This process is called SOCE (Store Operated
Calcium Entry).
I am trying to find out the role of dorai and dSTIM in neurons in
Drosophila. Pan-neuronal over expression of dorai rescued the lethality of
orai3/orai3 flies but not the adult flight and wing posture defect. From
the data it can be concluded that dorai in neurons is important for the
survival of larvae and adults. Over expression of dorai in
Glutamatergic neurons rescued the larval growth defect but could not
rescue the larval lethality and adult phenotype.
It is known that dorai has 5 transcript variants. Semi quantitative PCR
results of these transcripts show that expression level of transcript A
and C decreases drastically in the brain of adult orai3/orai3 flies. Pan
neuronal over expression of dorai rescued transcript A but not the
transcript C. From this result, we can conclude that transcript A is
important in neurons for the survival of larvae and adults. Transcript C
might possibly have some role in wing posture and flight.
I am also trying to generate a STIM knock out strain of Drosophila. I am
following Homologous recombination to make the knock out.
Recent work shows that mammalian septin interacts with orai1 and it
affects SOCE. Hence I am trying to check whether pnut (a type of septin
which has a mammalian homologue) is also interacting with ITPR. Deletion
of single copy of pnut in background of different heteroallelic
combination of ITPR gave differential interaction at larval and pupal
stage. This data suggests that pnut interacts with itpr in domain specific
manner. <br> Persistent effects of chronic stress after stressor termination </br><br>Aversive stimuli or stressors activate adaptive allostatic systems to
effectively cope with the stressor. However, their prolonged activation
leads to a disruption of homeostasis and maladaptative responses. Both
acute and chronic forms of stress have detrimental effects on the
plasticity and function of the limbic regions of the brain namely - the
hippocampus, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the basolateral
amygdala (BLA).
While changes observed in the hippocampus and mPFC on exposure to stress
revert after a stress-free recovery period, previous studies in our lab
have shown that the effects of stress on BLA morphology and anxiety-like
behavior are of a temporally persisting nature. Chronic stress causes an
increase in BDNF levels in the BLA and an increase in dendritic
arborisation in pyramidal neurons of the BLA which persists upto atleast
21-days of recovery post stress. This coincides with a persistent increase
in anxiety-like behaviors. My study deals with the effects of chronic
stress after a 21-day recovery period on amygdala-dependent fear
conditioning and spinogenesis in BLA pyramidal neurons. <br> Understanding the role of gap junctions in the developmental
 assembly of the zebrafish larval escape network. </br><br>In electrical synapses neurons are connected directly to each other via
gap junctional channel allowing bidirectional flow of current at
relatively short time scales thus mediating quicker responses. Previous
studies have shown that transient expression of electrical synapses occurs
early on in development prior to neural circuit formation leading to the
hypothesis that electrical synapses send instructional cues for the
formation of chemical synapses. To investigate how gap junctions regulate
neural circuit assembly we have chosen the escape network of the zebrafish
larva as our model system wherein neurons connected via mixed-synapses
(i.e., synapses containing both electrical and chemical synapses) mediate
the ?C-start? behavioral escape response. Our first attempt is to see the
abundance of gap junctions in the larval nervous system. I shall discuss
my results for the presence of Connexin35 (monomer of the gap junction) at
different developmental stages of the zebrafish larva and results from my
retrograde dye labeling experiment. <br> Identification of small molecule inhibitors for Hedgehog multimers
 involved in long-range signaling. </br><br>Hedgehog proteins are intercellular long-range signaling molecules that
spread within tissues and activate gene expression during development.
Aberrant Hedgehog pathway activation is involved in the development of
many tumors. The project is based on the previous findings that Hedgehog
forms nanometer-sized oligomers that localize in proteoglycan-rich
clusters at the surface of cells expressing Hedgehog. This nanoscale
organization and enrichment in clusters ensures that Hedgehog is able to
spread and activate signaling over many cell diameters. Computational
approaches are used to find small molecules that could inhibit the
interaction of multimers. Virtual screening enabled the identification of
800 molecules out of 1,71000 small molecules, which are worthwhile for
further in-vitro assays.
Comparative sequence analysis has been performed on Drosophila hedgehog
and mammalian hedgehog sequences, using evolutionary trace approach, to
understand the sequence conservation and variations. These results are
consistent with the findings that the interaction of Hedgehog with the
co-receptors is different across the phyla. Based on the results, it is
proposed that mammalian and Drosophila Hedgehog proteins have to be
treated separately in all stages of analysis. <br> Structural Analysis of Olfactory Receptors </br><br>Olfactory Receptors (ORs) are members of the Class A rhodopsin like
G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) which are the initial players in the
signal transduction cascade, leading to signals for detection of odorant
molecules in brain. The combinatorial response to odours by these
receptors gives rise to hoards of data to analyse. In spite of the
accumulation of thousands of olfactory receptor sequences, no structures
of ORs are known till date. The recent availability of crystallographic
models of a few GPCRs permits us to generate 3D-structural models of ORs
and analyze their structurally and functionally important amino acids. In
order to understand the odor recogonition by the receptors, we collected
and classified OR protein sequences from five different eukaryotic
organisms.
As a case study, we built the model of OR83b (Orco in Drosophila
melanogaster), an olfactory receptor co-receptor. OR83b is known to form
heterodimers with other ORs in insects and is essential in vivo for their
localization and function. OR83b has been predicted to have seven
transmembrane helix domain with connecting loops, similar to GPCRs
(G-protein coupled receptors) but with an intracellular N-terminus. The
OR/OR83b complex is able to shift ion selectivity of measured amount, a
property directly related to ion channels.
 Therefore, OR83b has a dual functional property i.e; intracellular
signalling and pore forming channel. We had employed a dual template
modeling approach to obtain the 3D-model of OR83b. Using the
electrostatic map of the model, we could show that OR83b contains a
probable negatively charged region that could form the pore for an ion
channel. Knowing that OR83b forms heterodimers, we built models of OR22a
(an OR in D.melanogaster with known function)-Or83b complex. This model
helped us to predict the probable dimer interface of OR/OR83b complex
which is an attractive target to design insect repellents.
We next generated structural models of 100 olfactory receptors to analyse
their residue conservation and dimer interfaces. Starting from the
available phylogenetic tree of olfactory receptor sequences in different
genomes, we were able to map the residue conservation and dimer interface
on the structural models of representative ORs to see the variation across
different subclusters. Residues that bind to G-proteins were found to be
conserved across all mammalian OR sequences and contain similar known GPCR
motifs. Other functionally conserved residues specific to sub-groups in
the phylogenetic tree could play important role in odor-recogonition and
dimerization. One could use these predictions for both
small-molecule-protein and protein-protein docking studies. This study
helps us to understand how olfactory receptors retain sequence
fingerprints to recognise hundred thousand odors in the environment. <br> Using zebrafish to characterize autism related gene </br><br>Autism Susceptibility Candidate 2 (Auts2) gene is implicated in autism and
mental retardation (Sultana et al., 2002; Kalscheuer et al., 2007). Auts2
codes for a nuclear protein whose function is still unknown F.Bedogni et
al., 2010). The zebrafish orthologue of the gene is present on chromosome
10 and the protein product shares a 62% identity with its human
orthologue. Knocking down Auts2 levels by injecting morpholino antisense
oligonucleotides against its mRNA leads to larvae with smaller heads,
smaller eyes and less number of neurons in the midbrain region. These
larvae do not move or move very sluggishly in response to touch. These
defects are rescued by human auts2 mRNA suggesting that the protein
product of the auts2 gene has a similar function in humans and in
zebrafish (Nadav Ahituv, personal communication).
I was able to replicate the auts2 knock-down phenotype seen in Dr.
Ahituv?s lab. These larvae also do not respond to visual stimulus
suggesting that there might be some defect in their reticulospinal
network. To test this, I performed retrograde labelling experiments to
identify the reticulospinal neuronal population in auts2 morphants. I also
performed whole mount immunohistochemistry experiments using the anti-
tyrosine hydroxylase antibody to label dopaminergic neurons. I will be
discussing the results from these experiments. <br> Study of the molecular aspects of salt tolerance in suspension
 culture cells of Oryza sativa, cultivars Pokkali and IR20 </br><br>Rice Oryza sativa, a staple food in most parts of the world, is a highly
salt sensitive crop. In plants Sodium (Na+) competitively inhibits vital
cellular processes involving Potassium (K+), at higher concentrations.
Salinity also manifests itself in the form of oxidative stress and ionic
imbalance inside cells (Masmoudi et al.2012).
Intracellular sodium levels have been measured in suspension cells of Rice
varieties Jaya (moderately sensitive) and Pokkali (resistant) using SBFI
(ratiometric dye). It was observed that Pokkali suspension cells maintain
lower intracellular [Na+] as compared with Jaya, when encountered with
salt stress. There is an order of magnitude difference in the plasma
membrane permeability between the two cultivars .This observation was also
well correlated with the survival of the two cultivars upon exposure to
increasing concentration of NaCl (Anil et al.2007).
It is possible that the difference in permeability could be due to
different transporters, channels or also in terms of their relative
densities on the membrane. We are currently trying to see if such
differences are also observed between a highly sensitive variety IR20 and
Pokkali. We are employing fluorescent probes specific for Na+ to measure
the plasma membrane permeability. In the event of a significant difference
in the membrane permeability of the two cultivars, we plan to study, if it
is indeed attributable to different composition of transporters/channels
through 2D gel electrophoresis/Mass spectrometry. <br> Onset of spermatogenesis in diabetic rats. </br><br>Diabetes Mellitus(DM) is a metabolic disorder, where the body does not
produce enough insulin or respond properly to insulin. DM is associated
with various complications including reproductive function. The onset of
DM in childhood is also on the rise. However, there is no data available
on the effect of DM on the onset of spermatogenic process. Therefore, the
current study is to examine whether or not there is an effect on the onset
of spermatogenesis and reproductive function thereof in STZ-induced
diabetic rats.
The diabetic rats were monitored for 50, 100 and 150 days post- partum.
The body weight of the STZ treated rats decreased with the increase in
blood glucose in all three groups compared to respective controls.?
However, the decrease in the testicular and epididymal weight of diabetic
rats was significant only at 150 days. No significant differences were
observed in the percentages of testicular cells or DNA condensation status
of cauda sperm between diabetic and control groups at all the intervals
studied. Interestingly, the mitochondrial membrane potential of diabetic
rat sperm was significantly low (p=0.02) compared to control indicating
the poor functional quality. <br> Serotonergic modulation of the fruit fly olfactory system </br><br>In insects, olfaction is an important chemosensory system required for
variety of vital tasks. The primary olfactory information from the
environment is brought by the Olfactory Sensory Neurons (ORNs), which
synapse onto Projection Neurons (PNs) which project to the higher centers
in the central brain. However, olfactory processing is not a linear system
involving only ORNs and PNs, the system is much more complicated by
presence variety of interneurons of diverse neurotransmitters and
neuromodulators. One of such neuromodulator present is Serotonin (5HT). In
the primary olfactory center, a pair of wide field neurons, the CSD
neurons, seems to the only source of 5HT.
In the present study, we are looking at the role of CSD neuron in
olfactory behavior of Drosophila melanogaster and how such a wide field
modulatory neuron can act differently for different odors. Using an
approach of anatomical, genetic and behavioral methods, we show the
behavioral role of CSD neuron and how the behaviorally relevant mapping of
the terminals of this neuron is programmed developmentally. <br> Control Strategies for Stable Locomotion on Uneven Terrain </br><br>Humans are arguably among the best long-distance runners in the animal
kingdom. This may have played an important role in human evolution by
enabling persistence hunting strategies. However, the control strategies
used by us to maintain stability while running on natural, uneven terrains
is not fully understood. We hypothesize that the nervous system uses the
leg not simply as a motor, but also as a mechacanical filter that actively
tunes its shock absorbing properties (impedance) to smooth out the effects
of uneven terrains. Given the premium on energy expenditure, we
hypothesize that this impedance tuning is driven by competing demands on
stability versus energy consumption. Given that stance durations at
typical marathon-running speeds is only 150-200 ms, not much greater than
most sensory feedback timescales (> 100 ms), we further hypothesize that
leg impedance properties are modulated by sensory feedback over two or
more steps, and not within a single stance period. For terrains with
increasing degree of unevenness, we expect higher energy dissipation in
the leg, driven by increasing demands on stability maintenance. This leads
to a greater metabolic cost of transport (energy consumed per unit body
weight per unit distance travelled) at a fixed average running speed. I
will discuss methods to construct stochastic terrains with well-defined
statistical properties, and present some theoretical calculations on the
collision mechanics of a simple bipedal walking model as well how to find
periodic solutions of a simple running model by optimization. These
theoretical calculations were done as a precursor to our model-based
estimation of leg impedance from experimental data. <br> Neuronal activity during visually driven decision making in larval
 zebrafish brain </br><br>The ability of the brain to make appropriate behavioral decisions is
essential for an organism?s survival. I believe that in lower vertebrate
systems, we will be able to identify simpler decision making circuits,
than we know of now from primate and rodent models, whose functioning can
be studied extensively by electrophysiological and imaging approaches.
In my study, I use visually driven attractive and aversive responses,
which can be evoked reliably in >7 day old zebrafish larvae [Bianco, I. H.
et al. 2011], to identify decision making processes involved in the
selection of the appropriate motor program. My experimental approach
involves presenting visual stimuli to evoke attractive or aversive
responses in immobilized fish, which have a calcium sensor to monitor
activity in brain areas of interest, while monitoring motor output
electrophysiologically. In this AWS, I will discuss my behavioral
paradigm, attempts at calcium imaging and extracellular motor pattern
recordings. <br> The mechanism of tau fibril formation: a story from multiple probes </br><br>Tau is an intrinsically unordered protein whose aggregation into ordered
structures called amyloid fibrils is implicated in neurodegenerative
diseases such as Alzheimer?s disease and the Tauopathies. The focus of my
work is to understand the mechanism of amyloid fibril formation by tau in
the presence of the inducer heparin, using multiple biophysical probes.
Previous work on characterizing the kinetics of tau fibril formation,
largely using ThioflavinT (ThT) fluorescence as a probe, revealed the
existence of an off-pathway intermediate that led to the transient
formation of non-fibrillar and protofibrillar aggregates (ThT is a dye
that is known to bind the beta-sheet regions of amyloid fibrils). The
aggregation mechanism was found to conform to ligand-induced nucleation
dependent polymerization and the kinetic role of the inducer heparin was
delineated to the nucleation step (Ramachandran and Udgaonkar, 2011). A
high-resolution picture of the kinetics of tau aggregation was however
missing.
In this AWS, I will discuss recent experiments using UV Resonance Raman
spectroscopy as a tool to understand the nature of structural transition
as a function of aggregation time. The Raman data indicate that the final
tau fibrils possess both ordered beta sheets and disordered regions. By
following the intensity evolution of Raman bands that are characteristic
of disordered conformations, I find evidence that the disordered regions
of fibrils evolve concurrent with ThT-positive beta-sheet structures. By
following the intensity evolution of a Raman band that is characteristic
of beta-sheet conformation, I find evidence that the cross-beta core of
the fibril orders on a time scale slower than ThT fluorescence. And
finally, by following the intensity evolution of an aromatic band, I find
evidence that the solvent accessibility of the aromatic residues changes
gradually, over the entire time course of aggregation. These results
contribute towards the understanding of generic principles of amyloid
fibril formation, in addition to enhancing knowledge of the mechanism of
tau fibril formation. <br>  Structure and function studies of Rieske-Oxygenase like Dehydrogenases </br><br><p>&nbsp;Oxygenases are enzymes that oxidize a substrate using Oxygen</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> <br> Specific recognition of different operators by the transcription
 factor AraR </br><br>Transcription factors modulate gene expression primarily through specific
recognition of cognate sequences resident in the promoter region of target
genes. AraR (Bacillus subtilis) is a repressor of genes involved in
L-arabinose metabolism. It binds to eight different operators present in
five different promoters with distinct affinities through a DNA binding
domain (DBD) at the N-terminus. In the absence of L-arabinose, AraR
represses transcription of about 13 genes required for arabinose
utilization. In the presence of L-arabinose, repression of these genes is
abolished and the transcription of metabolic operon (araABDLMNPQ-abfA) and
araE gene increases by 50-fold and that of araR gene by 4-fold. We have
determined high resolution X-ray crystal structures of AraR-DBD in complex
with four different natural operators. These structures provide a basis
for recognition of distinct operator sequences with different affinities
by AraR. The structural strategies utilized by AraR to achieve specific
binding to different target sequences will be presented. <br> Analysis of sequence patterns influencing mechanism of 3D-domain
 swapping in proteins and selection of best representatives of
 protein families. </br><br>3D-domain swapping is a mechanism of protein oligomerization where two or
more identical protein molecules associate by exchanging identical
structural elements, such that their native intra-molecular interactions
are replaced by their intermolecular counterparts. Proteins involved in
domain swapping are also reported to be involved in conformational
diseases. We have in-house database of 293 PDB entries of 3D-domain
swapped proteins with extensive literature curation. Recently number of
domain swapped entries has drastically increased, enforcing us to update
the database. This updated version has also provided us high quality data
for further analysis of these proteins, where we annotated these entries
at sequence, structure and function level. In this AWS, I am going to
discuss about the workflow of 3DSwap update. Further, analyzing
sequence-structure features of these proteins to develop a tool for
prediction of 3D-domain swapping in given sequence using Random Forest
approach. Availability of such resources, with its extensive content and
information related to domain swapping, may give further insight of domain
swapping. Further, we are planning to apply this algorithm on human
proteome. Prediction or early identification of proteins engaged in domain
swapping might help to target genes involved in deposition and
neurodegenerative diseases. I have also participated in the one-time
computer-intensive search of best representatives of protein families,
starting from the central repository of protein domain families, the PFAM
database. During this update, we could identify representatives for 13399
out of 13672 domain families. Availability of such a resource of
representatives can aid the robust construction of protein family
libraries and remote homology detection. <br> Understanding the interaction of Septins with essential
 components of intracellular calcium signaling in Drsosophila
 melanogaster. </br><br>Inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate(InsP3) is generated intracellularly in
response to a variety of signals like hormones, neurotransmitters and
growth factors. It binds to and opens up the InsP3 receptor(InsP3R) ,
through which Calcium is released from the ER store into the cytosol. This
drop in ER calcium is sensed by ER membrane protein STIM that aggregates
and helps in the assembly of Orai channels in the plasma membrane , which
allows influx of extracellular calcium into the cytosol, a process termed
Store Opertaed Calcium Entry(SOCE).Importance of SOCE in Drosophila larval
neurons for flight physiology has been demonstrated(Gayatri V et al,
PNAS,2009). Thus, adult phenotypes like wing posture and flight defect
displayed by heteroallelic combinations of InsP3R mutants could be 
rescued by restoring neuronal SOCE back to normal levels. Rescue of adult
phenotypes of InsP3R mutants by hypermorphic alleles of dOrai hinted at a
genetic interaction between the two proteins. Septins , a class of P loop
GTPases that form several heterooligomeric structures inside the cells
have recently been found to have a role in SOCE(Anjana Rao, personal
communication). In an attempt to investigate the role played by septins in
mediating the genetic interaction between InsP3R and dOrai , a genetic
interaction between InsP3R and one of the 5 Drosophila septins, Pnut was
uncovered(Trayambak, unpublished). The current goal of my project is to
understand the cell type specificity of this interaction and also to
understand how the different septins present in Drosophila and their
interactions might contribute to the phenotype observed. Investigation of
the neuronal calcium homeostasis is also underway to understand whether
modulation of SOCE is responsible for the phenotypes observed. <br> How to push with your fingertip? </br><br>We push on surfaces like switches and cell phone buttons with our
fingertips everyday. On the contrary, when a robotic finger contacts a
surface the finger will become unstable and "buckle" unless precisely
controlled. This instability that is intrinsic to both robotic and animal
fingers, causes one or more joint angles to undergo a sudden large change
and the fingertip will slip on the surface. Why is it that such
instabilities are rare in healthy humans? Is it because of precise
sensorimotor control, or do the nonlinear mechanical properties of muscles
and tendons underlie the ease with which humans handle contacts? We
develop a mathematical model for a finger in contact with a surface, and
design an elastic network to stabilize the finger through an
unconventional use of optimal control theory. Such elasticity in the human
finger is the outcome of both passive and neurally regulated properties of
muscle. Our calculations suggest experiments that can delineate the
relative roles of neural feedback and muscle mechanical properties in
finger stability, and also point to possible selection pressures that
drove the complex tendon architecture of the finger. Our theory
generalizes to any limb with any number of segments. <br> Study of changes in properties of the cardiac contractile system
 due to cardiomyopathy associated mutations in &#945;-tropomyosin </br><br>Although the heart muscle possesses an incredible ability to tolerate and
adapt to pathological insults in order to maintain the contractile
function, its long-term response to these insults is a maladaptive
remodeling process characterized by hypertrophy and/or dilation. Single
point mutations in any one of the genes encoding the fundamental
sarcomeric proteins have been found to cause inherited cardiomyopathies. I
am interested in looking at the mutations in the gene encoding
&#945;-tropomyosin (TPM1). Both hypertrophic and dilated
cardiomyopathy-causing point mutations have been found in the TPM1 gene. I
aim to determine the molecular mechanism(s) by which the single point
mutations in the tropomyosin molecule cause either hypertrophic or dilated
cardiomyopathy and try to find the commonalities and differences in them.
I will be conducting the study by reconstituting the basic regulated
sarcomere (myosin, actin, troponin, tropomyosin) in vitro and looking at
the effect of these mutations on the binding affinity to actin, ATPase
activity of the regulated sarcomere and its sensitivity to calcium,
sliding velocity of the regulated thin filament and force generated by the
sarcomere. I also plan to look at the way in which these changes at the
molecular level are translated to the cellular level. For this I will
study the effect of these mutations on force generation by single
cardiomyocytes, either derived from induced pluripotent stem cells of
human patients or human embryonic stem cells expressing mutant TPM1 gene.
A thorough understanding of biochemical and biophysical properties 
provides a foundation for us to design therapies using small molecules and
stem-cells. Currently I have started work with a dilated cardiomyopathy
mutation, D230N. I will be discussing a few initial biochemical
experiments that have revealed consistent changes in actin binding of this
mutant. <br> Study of ultra structure of myoblast fusion in Drosophila. </br><br>Myoblast fusion is an essential process for the development, growth and
regeneration of muscles in multi cellular organisms. However the cellular
behaviour and ultra structural changes that underscore this process remain
less clear. In the current study, I have used conventional TEM (chemical
fixation of tissue)to elucidate the ultra structure of myoblast fusion
using Drosophila Indirect Flight Muscles (IFMs) as a model. My results
show that myoblast fusion happens in five steps. Following recognition and
adhesion of myoblast with myotube an electron dense material
accumulates at the contact site, membrane breaks and pore formation occurs
. The electron dense material gets cleared from the membranes at the
contact leaving multiple pores between the myoblast and myotube and
remnants of the membrane are removed resulting in complete fusion of the
cells. Given the conventional chemical fixation is prone to artifacts, I
am optimizing more reliable techniques like High Presuure Freezing/Freeze
substitution (HPF/FS) to describe the process myoblast fusion in greter
detail. <br> Vesicular release of Sonic hedgehog </br><br>The Hedgehog family of proteins encodes highly conserved morphogens
involved in patterning of developing tissues. Hedgehog proteins are
post-translationally modified by cholesterol at the C-terminus, and
palmitate at the N-terminus, and these lipid modifications are thought to
anchor the morphogen to the plasma membrane of producing cells. Cells that
produce Hedgehog fail to activate its signaling, making the release and
transport of this membrane-anchored morphogen mandatory. My project is
aimed at understanding the mechanisms of efficient release of this
membrane-anchored morphogen. In my talk, I will present results that
suggest that Sonic Hedgehog is released in at least two different
vesicular forms that also ferry other cellular proteins as well as RNA.
Current experiments are focused on deciphering the molecular players
involved in generation of these distinct vesicular pools of Sonic hedgehog
and their physiological relevance in paracrine signaling in mouse embryoid
bodies and chick embryos. <br> Identifying novel genes in the synaptic vesicle transport pathway </br><br>Axonal transport is an important process required for various
developmental phenomena such as synapse formation, synapse maintenance and
hence neuronal function One of the major cargos transported in neurons are
pre-synaptic vesicles (PSVs) carrying neurotransmitters and SNAREs, which
play an essential role in synaptic transmission. The major anterograde
motor that transports PSVs in axons in C. elegans is UNC-104 (Kinesin-3).
To identify new genes in the PSV transport pathway, I have performed an
enhancer screen targeted to the UNC-104 dependent PSV transport using a
hypomorph of unc-104 previously isolated in the lab. The criteria for my
2-step enhancer screen were worsened behavior in the worm and altered PSV
distribution in a subset of neurons. Of the 16 mutants thus obtained, I
have separated three from the unc-104 mutation and they have varied
effects on PSV distribution along the axon as well as reduced presence in
the synapse. I will discuss these characteristics and other genetic
interactions of these isolated mutants. In the future I will clone and
characterize these mutants and assess the effect of the new protein on the
localization and dynamic transport properties of PSVs. <br> Studying the chain collapse in single chain monellin using steady
 state FRET. </br><br>Hydrophobic collapse involves the chain contraction when a polypeptide
chain is transferred from a good solvent to a bad solvent. Collapse helps
in reducing conformational heterogeneity and decreases the time taken for
the unfolded protein to fold into native form. Many proteins undergo
folding through a collapsed intermediate. Time scale of collapse reaction
ranges from few tens of ns to several seconds. Initial collapse can be
detected by burst phase loss in the signals of different spectroscopic
probes in ms measurements. The specificity and cooperativity of initial
collapse during protein folding is poorly understood. Much of the
difficulty in characterizing collapse reaction comes from its fast nature
and inability in separating it temporally from the secondary structure
formation.
The model system used in my study is single chain Monellin, a variant of a
heterodimeric, sweet plant protein. The folding and unfolding reactions of
single chain monellin have been well characterized(Patra etal 2007,Jha
etal 2009)..
The aim of present study is to study the collapse of single chain Monellin
using steady state Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer as a
spectroscopic probe and to study the kinetics of refolding. In the current
study single tryptophan residue at position 4 was used as FRET donor and
TNB labelled attached to single cysteine residue is used as acceptor. The
refolding was initiated by rapidly diluting the denaturant using stopped
flow instrument. In this AWS I will present the preliminary data on the
equilibrium unfolding and kinetic refolding experiments. <br> Evolution of dynamin superfamily in eukaryotes </br><br>Dynamins are large GTPases involved in variety of membrane remodelling
events like mitochondrial and peroxisomal fission, mitochondrial fusion,
chloroplasts fission, endocytosis, antiviral activity, cell plate
formation and cytokinesis etc. It is interesting to study the evolution of
dynamins at the superfamily level to understand the order in which
different functional subclasses evolved from one another. Also, the study
will throw light upon whether evolutionary rates differ amongst different
functional subclasses, a point not yet incorporated in current
phylogenetic approaches. To study the evolution of dynamins as far back as
LECA (1.8 billion years ago), we developed a novel adaptation of parsimony
based approach. I shall also discuss the probable roles of dynamins in
LECA. <br> Structural and Biochemical Studies on the Pre-Initiation State of
 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) from Japanese Encephalitis 
Virus </br><br>Flaviviruses are responsible for widespread diseases such as dengue,
yellow fever and encephalitis. A multiprotein complex including RdRp -
termed ?replisome?- mediates replication of the viral RNA genome upon
infecting host cell. Flaviviral RdRps can initiate replication in the
absence of a primer. These enzymes require high concentrations of GTP to
catalyze template dependent RNA synthesis ab initio.
We have determined the crystal structure of RdRp from Japanese
Encephalitis Virus (jRdRp) in complex with the initiator nucleotide GTP
(2.4 ?). The jRdRpGTP structure provides a basis for the specific
recognition of GTP and shows that this nucleotide binds to jRdRp in an
unexpected conformation. Mutation of key residues that interact with GTP
to alanine had a drastic effect on ab initio synthesis but only a minimal
effect on primer extension. Hence, the jRdRpGTP structure may represent a
previously uncharacterized pre-initiation state. In addition, GTP binding
reduces the affinity of RdRp for RNA, but the presence of Mn2+ in the mix
abolishes this inhibition. Taken together, these observations suggest a
sequence of events during initiation that will prevent adventitious
template independent RNA synthesis that may be erroneous. In this AWS, I
will discuss these results on RdRp initiation. I will also discuss the
attempts to characterize JEV NS3 protein, which together with RdRp forms a
minimal replisome. <br> Spike detection in high density microelectrode array recordings </br><br>High density microelectrode arrays enable studies of neuronal activity in
cultures with a high spatial and temporal resolution. However, the high
density of electrodes sets a limit on the size of preamplifiers,
resulting in a large amount of thermal noise in the data. I show that this
causes problems for spike detection in cultures and that for a large
fraction of spikes will be subthreshold when a conservative threshold is
applied during the spike detection. Next, I address the question how well
the spike detection performs at a particular recording channel in
relation to the applied threshold. Based on correlations with the
activity in other recording channels, I estimate the fraction of falsely
detected spikes and show that this procedure works as well in recordings
of the immature retina in mice. Finally, I will show some implications on
spike statistics. <br> Understanding the role of 5-HT2A in the action of antipsychotics </br><br>Schizophrenia is a devastating mental disorder with 1% world prevalence.
Antipsychotic drugs have been the preferred treatment choice to treat
schizophrenia, since their discovery in 1950s. Antipsychotic drugs can
effectively treat hallucinations, delusion (positive symptoms) but have
limited success in treating the negative symptoms (social isolation,
anhedonia, lack of motivation), and cognitive impairments. They also have
severe side effects, for example, increased risk of diabetes, weight gain
and cardiovascular disorders. Even though antipsychotics have been in use
for a very long time, their mechanism of action is not very well
understood. Primarily, the antagonism of serotonin receptor type 2A
(5-HT2A) and dopamine receptor (D2) is believed to be at the base of the
mode of action of antipsychotics. However contribution of independent
GPCRs to clinical effects and to side effects of antipsychotics still
remains obscure. My work concentrates on studying the role of 5-HT2A in
the action of antipsychotics. Moreover 5-HT2A is known to regulate glucose
metabolism, so am also looking at the role of 5-HT2A in antipsychotic
mediated side effects (hyperglycemia, weight gain). To specifically
address 5-HT2A dependent action of antipsychotics we have developed, in
collaboration with Rupasri Ain at NCBS, a 5-HT2A knock out mouse model. In
my AWS I will talk about the validation and characterization of this
global 5-HT2A knock out mouse and the preliminary data on the role of
5-HT2A in the side effects of antipsychotics. <br> Intracellular calcium signaling in dopaminergic neurons is
 required for Drosophila flight </br><br>Store operated calcium entry (SOCE) has been studied extensively in
non-excitable cells in the context of cellular signaling during immune
function. However, the relevance of SOCE, if any, to neuronal development
and function is poorly understood (1). SOCE can be activated through the
Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) signaling pathway. IP3 signaling occurs
in response to the stimulation of certain G-protein coupled receptors by
extracellular ligands and leads to production of intracellular IP3, which
binds to its cognate receptor (IP3R) present on the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) which releases Ca2+ into the cytosol from ER Ca2+ stores. The stores
are refilled through the concerted action of SOCE components and the
sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase or SERCA (1).
Previous studies in the lab have shown that heterozygous mutants for IP3R
gene of Drosophila (itpr) exhibit altered wing posture, flight defects,
increased spontaneous firing in the Dorso-longitudinal muscles (DLMs) and
loss of rhythmic flight patterns in response to air-puff stimulation (2).
Over expression of wild-type itpr, in aminergic neurons could rescue these
phenotypes. More recently, we have shown that pan-neuronal depletion of
IP3R and SOCE molecules through RNA interference, gave rise to varying
degrees of flight defects (3, 4). To identify the cellular mechanisms
underlying these defects knock-down experiments were undertaken in
multiple neuronal sub-domains followed by measurement of flight behavior,
physiology and high-speed video recordings (5). Our data show that IP3R
and SOCE are required in distinct neuronal sub-domains for different
aspects of flight, such as initiation, maintenance and wing co-ordination.
We propose the involvement of a dopaminergic neuron in some of these
aspects. The cellular effect of IP3R and SOCE knock-down in the individual
domains is under investigation and will be discussed.

patterning </br><br>Adult wing development from imaginal discs is regulated by both signalling
via morphogens. Intracellular transport mechanisms are likely to be
important not only for morphogen secretion but also for the response of
target cells in the wing disc to these molecules. Lipids are central
players in cellular transport not only as inert cargo containers but also
in their capacity to modulate transport in developing cells. Phospholipids
such as phosphoinositides, phosphatidic acid (PA) and its
non-phosphorylated form diacylglycerol (DAG) are examples of signalling
lipids.
The Golgi is known to play an important role in sorting of cargo into
carriers destined for different membrane domains in polarized cells.
Protein kinase D (PKD)is described as a regulator of such events at the
trans-Golgi (TGN) controlling transport to distinct plasma membrane
domains. It has been postulated that DAG produced by phospholipase D (PLD)
is essential for recruitment of PKD to the TGN. In vitro, PKD has been
shown to regulate the activity of multiple phosphoinositide kinases;
phosphoinositides themselves have been shown to regulated transport at the
TGN.
I will present experimental data on the effects of manipulating PKD
activity in wing discs on adult wing pattern. Experiments on the effects
of manipulating PIP kinases will also be shown. The overall aim of this is
to understand the contribution of phosphoinositides in modulating the
transport processes during wing disc development. <br> Semaphorins are involved in the development of functional motor
 neuron connectivity in the Drosophila walking circuit </br><br>Walking is a rhythmic motion that is generated by the coordinated movement
of different legs and leg segments. Motor neurons that innervate muscles
induce contraction and relaxation of specific leg muscles in a regulated
manner. We are studying the mechanism underlying the development of
walking circuit. Motor neurons in adult flies are organized as a myotopic
map where the dendritic arborization of a particular motor neuron in the
central nervous system is related to the axonal innervations in the leg
muscles (Brierley et al 2009, 2011). Precise and explicit connectivity of
motor neurons with the muscles and pre-motor neurons (sensory and inter
neurons) leads to the generation of appropriate gait while walking. We
are using Semaphorins; well-studied axon guidance molecules to study the
development of functional leg-myotopic map. Temporal expression of these
molecules in neurons and muscles suggest that these could play role in the
development of the walking circuit. We demonstrate axon-
defasciculation defects, abnormal gait, upon RNAi mediated Semaphorin
knockdown in motor neurons. Furthermore, there is a coincidence of timing
of motor neuron dendritic field elaboration and leg muscle innervation
(Brierley et al., 2009, 2011) suggesting retrograde signals from the
muscles might be involved in the development of motor neurons. Also, RNAi
mediated knockdown of Semaphorins in muscles during development results in
abnormal gait. We are currently dissecting the role of Semaphorins as a
retrograde signal from muscles that is required for patterning of the
motor neurons. <br> Photo-physical characterization of Sandercyanin: A blue protein
 with red fluorescence. </br><br>Sandercyanin, the blue protein from Sander vitreus, is a new biliprotein
belongs to lipocalin super -family. It has absorbance maxima at 280, 385,
and 633 nm at physiological pH and has a strong fluorescence at 678nm in
the far-red region of electromagnetic spectrum when excited at 385nm and 
633nm. X-ray crystal structure of Sandercyanin showed that the protein
exists as a homo-tetramer with a molecular weight of 81kDa. An insight
into the crystal structure of the protein showed that it interacts
non-covalently with the chromophore, biliverdin. The chromophore is
surrounded by aromatic residue stacked against each other and charged
residues such as aspartate and glutamate which form H-bond and ionic
interactions with the molecule. We hypothesize that aromatic stacking and
H-bonding with biliverdin contribute to the large Stokes shift in
Sandercyanin. The project proposes to establish Sandercyanin as an
excellent bio-imaging marker. This primarily requires generation of a
recombinant protein that retains all the photochemical properties of the
natural protein. This involves understanding its spectroscopic and
microscopic properties and also the chemistry behind large Stokes shift.
Applications of Sandercyanin as a fluorescent tag for in-vivo studies
include tracking other protein / macromolecule movement in living cell,
studying protein dynamics and protein- protein interaction. Further, it
can be employed for cancer detection, immunological studies, and
whole-body imaging and stem cell research. <br> Using a DNA scaffold to enable ratiometric chloride ion sensing in
 sub-cellular compartments </br><br>Ions play important roles in biological systems. Among them Ca2+ is one of
the best understood second messenger due to the availability of
high-quality protein interfacable sensors. Chloride is the major
physiological anion, which is involved in different functions such as pH
homeostasis, neurotransmission, cell volume regulation etc. Therefore,
imbalance in [Cl-] leads to several diseases. Although, currently
available genetically encodable probes can be used to measure cell or
sub-cellular compartment specific Cl- concentration, the dependence of
their Cl- sensitivity to changes in physiological pH complicates data
analysis. There are some small fluorescent molecules which undergo dynamic
quenching by Cl- and thus can sense chloride ions with good sensitivity
and specificity. Importantly, these dyes are insensitive to changes in
physiological pH. Till date, there is no ratiometric Cl- sensitive dye.
However, using a DNA scaffold, one can easily and reproducibly combine a
Cl- sensitive and Cl- insensitive dye for ratiometric sensing of Cl-.
Later, an endocytosable ligand or protein-interface may also be conjugated
to the DNA scaffold which can be used to target the sensor to different
sub-cellular compartments i.e. endocytic vesicles, golgi, ER etc.
Therefore, combining the ion sensing ability of the small molecules and
the modularity of DNA scaffold, ratiometric sensing of chloride can be
achieved in sub-cellular compartments. In my previous AWS, I had discussed
the design of chloride sensors based on different BAC conjugated nucleic
acid scaffolds and their in vitro characterization. In this AWS, I will
discuss initial work that demonstrates functionality of such sensor inside
cells to study a putative CLC family chloride channel in Drosophila
melanogaster. <br> Targeting the I ? switch to different cellular locations </br><br>A eukaryotic cell function is tied to regulated uptake and secretion of
different bio-molecules. This is orchestrated by various functional fusion
events between different intracellular compartments: Plasma Membrane,
Early and Late Endosomes, Golgi Network, Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER),
Lysosomes to name a few. One of the most crucial factors in these fusion
events are pH of the lumen of these vesicular compartments. Luminal pH of
these vesicles are maintained by H+ and different other ion concentrations
such as Ca2+, Cl-, HCO3- etc inside the lumen. pH is the key factor in
events like endosomal fusion, protein sorting, posttranslational
modification of proteins and protein folding to name a few along the 
different biosynthetic, endocytic and secretory pathways of the cell.
Subtle changes in the pH can affect these important processes.
There are various protein based dyes which can act as fluorescence based
pH sensors e.g. GFP, Fluorescein etc., but the shortcomings with these
systems are their resolution at very small pH range. Our lab has made a
pH sensor called the I-switc,h that could map such subtle changes in pH
with
a high dynamic range between pH 5 and 7, which is ideal for monitoring
changes in intracellular pH. My project aims to target the I-switch
specifically to various compartments which are involved in the secretory
pathway. Due to the modular nature of DNA and diversity in conformations
that DNA can take in response to various environmental signals, it is
easier to measure the small molecules inside the cells. In order to
measure pH of the different compartments one would need to target the
I-switch to the organelle of choice, which would be done by taking the
advantage of the relevant organelle resident protein, attaching and fusing
it to a carrier protein (scFv) that functions as an artificial receptor
for the I-switch.
There are few evidence which demonstrate that ligands like CI-MPR takes a
complex route that involves multiple sorting steps in both early and late
endosomes It is also known that there is differential trafficking of two
transmembrane protein localised to the TGN, TGN38 and Furin. After
internalization, both eventually reach TGN, but via different trafficking
pathways. Given the fact that there exist many transport pathways in
endosomes, the final destination thus, cannot decide the identity of a
pathway. In our study, it has been observed that on cycloheximide (CHX)
treatment transiently transfected IA2.2 cells with scFv-Furin, shows TGN
localisation which is lost when the cells are removed from the CHX
treatment. We set out to identify the identity of this transient
compartment(if any) where the I-switch bound to scFv-Furin resides on CHX
removal and if, there is a difference in the pH in these compartments, 
whether we could use these pH read outs to identify the compartment where
the I-switch is residing temporarily. <br> Modeling plasticity in the context of stimulation of neighbouring
 dendritic spines. </br><br>Synaptic plasticity is currently the leading mechanism for learning and
memory formation. Out of the many neural network models, heterosynaptic
metaplasticity and clustered plasticity are two of the contending models.
Whereas heterosynaptic metaplasticity models require that the threshold
for LTP should increase at spines that are neighbouring to a spine at
which strong LTP has been induced, Clustered plasticity models predict
that the threshold should decrease.
Experiments on CA1 pyramidal neurons of mouse hippocampal slices have
shown(ex. Svoboda,2007) that strong stimulation in the form of an LTP
protocol at a single synapse can cause lowering of the LTP threshold at
nearby(< 10 microns away) spines located on the same dendrite. GTPRas has
been implicated in this phenomenon and an experiment by Svoboda's group in
2008 showed that GTP Ras activity indeed diffuses to the nearby spines in
a timescale of 10 minutes. Thus this phenomenon extends the rather
stringent requirement of the two stimuli to be within few milliseconds of
each other as in the case of STDP to a timescale of few minutes.
In this AWS I will present my work in progress for modeling this
phenomenon using the simulation module MOOSE that has been developed in
our lab. The model has various pathways like CaM, BDNF, GTPRas, MAPK etc
included and also various calcium stimuli can be given. <br> The impacts of logging in understorey birds: population- and
 community-level changes </br><br>Human-induced habitat modification is probably the most important driver
of biodiversity loss today, especially in the tropics. Despite a large
body of research on the impacts of selective logging and habitat
fragmentation on various plant and animal communities, an understanding of
the demographic drivers of these changes is still lacking. We investigated
the impact of logging on understorey bird communities on eight forest
patches that have experienced varying intensities of logging in in wet
temperate forest in Arunachal Pradesh. We use mist netting and bird
ringing to enable individual identification of birds, and mark-recapture
analyses to estimate population vital rates, especially population growth
rates. Sampling was carried out in during the breeding seasons in 2011 and
2012, and the post-breeding season in 2012. The interval between the
breeding and post-breeding season allows us to estimate reproductive
effort, whereas examining the population growth rate between a
post-breeding season and the following breeding season is indicative of
dispersal between patches with varying logging intensity. For the most
common species, the Yellow-throated Fulvetta (Alcippe cinerea), we find
evidence that is consistent with (a) reduced reproductive output with
increased logging, and (b) post-breeding dispersal from more intact 
patches to more logged patches. We hypothesise that populations in
intensely logged patches are sustained by immigration from intact patches.
At the community level, we also find that inter-annual variation in
community composition is positively related to logging intensity. We
suggest that population level process (such as differential dispersal with
habitat quality) act in conjunction with demographic stochasticity to
reduce the stability of communities in logged habitats. <br> Chaperone assisted folding of a dimeric protein </br><br>The cell cytoplasm has thousands of proteins being simultaneously
synthesized, making them prone to aggregation and degradation. Hence,
protein folding in a lot of cases in vivo is assisted by chaperones, which
ensures correct and timely formation of the natively folded structures.
The process of protein folding is complicated further for proteins which
are multimeric, because of the additional requirement of chain
complementation and shared folding codes in some cases.
Double chain monellin (DcMn) is a small, sweet plant protein, whose
folding and unfolding pathways have been studied in great details in the
lab. It's a hetero-dimeric protein, consisting of chains A and B of
roughly similar molecular weights, associated non-covalently. It provides
a good system for studying the process of chain complementation and the
process of complementation can be delineated from that of folding. It has
been shown for DcMn that completely unstructured chains associate to form
an encounter complex C, which then folds to the native state, utilizing
multiple pathways, with or without forming intermediates.
Experiments with single chain variant of monellin (ScMn) have shown that
GroEL (the most abundant E. coli chaperone) can modulate its folding
energy landscape by binding folding intermediates on parallel pathways in
different ways and with different affinities, and can also unfold late
productive intermediates through a thermodynamic coupling mechanism.
However studies with ScMn do not allow the analysis of the effect of the
chaperone system on the process of chain association, and any alteration
of the multiple folding pathways, if any. The overall aim of my project is
to use DcMn to look at the ability of the GroEL-ES chaperone system to
assist in the folding of this heterodimeric protein, and also intend to
delineate the process of chain association from that of folding. <br> Structure of pri-miRNA 17-92 cluster </br><br>MicroRNAs control gene expression either by transcript degradation or
translational repression. Expression of these miRNAs is highly regulated
in tissues, the misregulation of which leads to disease. But how this
regulation is achieved is still largely unknown. It is becoming clear that
regulation is achieved in many cases during biogenesis. To investigate
this we took a long polycistronic primary miRNA transcript containing six
miRNAs with diverse function. This cluster called pri-miR-17-92 undergoes
differential processing to produce different levels of mature miRNAs. We
considered the hypothesis that tertiary structure of this transcript could
result in asymmetric processing at the very initial stages. Thus we first
investigated the existence of any higher order structure formation by this
transcript. Earlier I have shown using SHAPE analysis, hydroxyl radical
foot printing as well as bulk biophysical methods that pri-miR-17-92
adopts a specific three dimensional architecture with solvent inaccessible
regions in an Mg2+ dependent manner. Now in this AWS, I will show the
secondary structure of the whole cluster which I could elucidate using a
fast acting reagent, benzoyl cyanide. Further DMS probing of the cluster
yielded the Hoogsteen base pairing sites in the pri-miRNA that mediated
tertiary contacts. This secondary structural map not only provides a means
to arrive at the tertiary structure but also indicates how protein binding
could modulate processing in a context dependent manner. <br> The role of clathrin independent pinocytic pathway in cell
 spreading </br><br>Eukaryotic cells employ multiple endocytic routes to internalize cell
surface receptors, nutrients, membrane proteins/lipids and extracellular
fluid. Clathrin mediated endocytic (CME) pathways are studied extensively,
but clathrin independent endocytic (CIE) pathways are emerging to have
critical roles in fundamental cellular processes. CLIC/GEEC (CG) pathway
is clathrin-dynamin independent and internalizes major fraction of fluid
and GPI-Anchored Proteins (GPI-AP). The CG pathway internalizes the
equivalent of entire plasma membrane surface area in under 15 minutes
giving it potential to rapidly alter membrane area and composition (1). 
Membrane delivery from recycling endosomal compartments and changes in
membrane tension is associated with processes such as cell spreading,
cell migration, mitosis and plasma membrane repair (1,2). A GPI-AP
containing recycling compartment has been implicated in providing membrane
area during cell spreading (3). Further, recent experiments involving
ablation of compartments derived from the CG pathway have demonstrated
that it is important for cell migration. We find that the fluid phase,
endocytosed via the CG pathway is rapidly regurgitated. Thus a high
capacity pathway like the CG pathway that rapidly regurgitates major
fraction of endocytic volume could help in membrane turnover during these
processes, but the exact mechanisms are not known.
Here I would discuss experiments suggesting that the fluid uptake pathway
is involved in membrane retrieval on cell rounding whereas CME pathway is
not. Also, fluid regurgitation is sensitive to cell spreading while
recycling of cargo endocytosed through CME pathway is insensitive to this
process. I would also discuss possible role of membrane tension in
coordinating these processes.

 secretion </br><br>Morphogens are signaling molecules involved in patterning of different
tissues across multiple systems. They are typically produced from a
localized source, spread across several cell diameters giving rise to a
gradient of signaling output; this spatial information in turn determines
cell fate in a spatially patterned manner Hedgehog is as a morphogen and
acts in many locations in the development of tissues in Drosophila
melanogaster. Hedgehog is dually lipidated, bearing cholesterol at its
C-terminus and a palmitoyl moiety at its N-terminus. Previous work from
our laboratory has shown that Hedgehog exhibits a hierarchical
organization at the cell surface: a specific protein-protein based
interaction results in an oligomeric structure at the nanoscale, essential
for the formation of higher order optically resolvable complexes with
Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG?s). This scale of organization is
necessary for long range signaling in the wing disc.
I have explored the biophysical and biochemical properties of secreted
Hedgehog in a cell culture based system in my previous Annual Work
presentations. Here I will summarize my findings from biochemical,
Fluorescence correlation spectroscopic (FCS) and other single particle
based measurements. My data suggest that Hedgehog is released in two
vesicular forms which can be distinguished on the basis of their size. I
will also present new data from recent studies using Electron
Microscopy-based approaches to study the nature of these secreted
particles in cell culture and in the Drosophila wing disc. I find using
immuno electron microscopy that secreted Hedgehog is associated with
vesicular structures (resembling exosomes). In cultured cells, as well as
in the wing discs Hedgehog is observed in the lumen of a multi vescicular
endosome (MVB) which is a likely cellular intermediate in the release of
exosomes. I will discuss my attempts at correlating the differential fate
of the nanoscale organized Hh and its mutant counterpart (HhK132D) which
fails to form these nanoscale structures with their observed differences
in secretion and its intracellular localization, to provide a mechanism
for the formation of the functional secretable morphogen. <br> To study the influence of early life enrichment on the
 neurobiological effects of stress </br><br>The amygdala and hippocampus exhibit strikingly different patterns of
plasticity in response to both positive and negative experiences. For
example, aversive experiences like chronic stress strengthen
amygdala-dependent cued fear memory and its cellular correlates in the
basolateral amygdala, while impairing hippocampal plasticity and spatial
memory. Paradoxically, positive experiences like environmental enrichment
weaken cued fear memory and impair amygdalar LTP, while hippocampal
plasticity and spatial memory are enhanced. This raises some intriguing
questions-can the contrasting plasticity patterns of an enriched
environment and stress counterbalance each other? Does an enriched brain
develop resilience to stress?
As a behavioural readout of hippocampal and amygdalar function, we tested
for contextual fear memory formation using a paradigm that restricts the
amount of time given to the hippocampus to encode its spatial context. 
While control and chronically stressed rats both showed low freezing
responses indicating poor memory, enriched animals showed a robust
contextual fear memory. Interestingly, stressed rats that were raised in
an enriched environment showed a higher recall of fear memory. In order to
gain insight in to the cause of this enhanced memory we are currently
using c-fos as an activity marker to map neuronal populations activated by
the contextual fear conditioning paradigm. <br> Sculpting circuits in the cerebellum: Role of gap junctions and
 balance between inhibition and excitation. </br><br>The cerebellum is essential for coordination and precision of movement and
motor learning even though it does not initiate movement. Analysis of fine
structure of the cerebellum revealed a layered structure with the Purkinje
neurons (PNs) forming the most superficial cellular layer. The PN is the
main output neuron in the cerebellar circuit and receives input from
granule cells in the form of parallel fibres and from the inferior olive
in the form of climbing fibres. It also receives inputs from inhibitory
interneurons. The number of synapses and the strength of synapses in all
these various inputs are markedly different making this system ideal for
studying circuit development. Inhibitory to excitatory balance (I/E
ratios) in any neural circuit is crucial for efficient circuit output and
there are numerous neurophysiological disorders like autism,
schizophrenia and epilepsy associated with disturbed I/E ratios. It is
however unknown how these ratios contribute to development of a circuit.
Immunohistochemistry experiments show a strong expression of gap junction
proteins in the cerebellum all through development. How these gap
junctions may affect I/E ratios or circuit development in general is yet
to be found out. Therefore, my objective is to study these aspects by 
a)perturbing the I/E balance and b)knocking down gap junctions in the Pns
early in development and observing how it affects cellular and synaptic
conductances. I have recorded from PNs in 4dpf Indian wildtype zebrafish
larvae in whole cell mode and found two populations of spontaneous
synaptic currents, large( -193 ? 20 pA) and small (-25 ? 10 pA) (n=15
cells from 6 larvae). Episodic stimulation revealed strong outward
currents above -40 mV (n=7 cells from 4 larvae). Overexpressing a short
peptide comprising the last 15 amino acids at the carboxy terminus (CT) of
the connexin (Cx) 35 protein has been shown to reduce junctional coupling
in goldfish (Perada et al ,2011 ). I have made a construct with the
corresponding CT peptide in zebrafish , which I will use to knock down gap
junctions and study circuit effects. <br> Optically Probing for CA3-CA1 Connectivity in Hippocampus </br><br>The mammalian hippocampus is thought to be the region involved in the
formation of new memories. The leading mechanism for memory formation is
believed to be the change in the strengths of synapses, also referred to
as synaptic plasticity. To understand more about the distribution of
synaptic strengths and how they change with plasticity, the hippocampal
CA3-CA1 network was chosen. Based on a novel method proposed in Bhalla,
Plos Comp. Biol., 2008, we tried to detect the presence of individual
synapses and estimate their weights. With eventual the aim of scaling up
the technique to read a large number of synaptic weights simultaneously,
fluorescence changes were recorded on addition of single and multiple
synapse equivalents from calcium sensitive dye loaded CA1 neurons. We were
able to detect changes caused by ~5 synapse equivalent currents on neurons
near firing threshold. Additionally, we have built a projector based
patterned illumination system for stimulating neurons expressing
Channelrodopsin2 (ChR2). A DLP projector, optically aligned to the
microscope, projects a miniaturized image onto the sample through the
objective ? to selectively stimulate specific sets of cells. Our aim is to
narrow it down to, if possible, effective single cell stimulation to probe
into the weight distributions. In my talk, I will discuss the method of
detecting synaptic equivalents from neuronal calcium dye signals and my
results of optical stimulation of Chr2 expressing neurons. <br> Engineering Domain Swapping in single chain Monellin </br><br><p>Domain swapping is a mode of protein self-association where dimers or higher order protein oligomers are formed from monomeric species by secondary or tertiary structural element exchange. L<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: Cambria; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;">ength and flexibility of the loop connecting the elements that exchange (hinge loop) are known to be the major energetic determinants of domain swapping. Efforts to identify the sequence determinants of the hinge loop, however, have met with little success. In fact, it has been demonstrated that the hinge loop doesn&rsquo;t differ much from other loops in a protein in its amino acid distribution, though some amino-acid residues like proline and valine have been found to occur more often in the hinge loop. In this AWS, I'll show that a five amino acid motif (QXVXG) conserved for functional reasons in the cystatin superfamily is sufficient to drive domain swapping in a protein which doesn&rsquo;t otherwise domain swap. Different parts of the same protein can be made to swap using this stretch, generating different folds from the same starting monomer. We could also generate a double domain-swapped dimer, demonstrating the ease with which different domain swapping interfaces can be generated in a protein using this motif. Given the applications of domain swapping in protein assembly and regulation of protein functions, the prospect of developing a motif that can act as an &ldquo;inducer&rdquo; of domain swapping is very exciting.</span></p> <br> Coordination of multiple endocytic pathways in metazoa </br><br>At any given time, multiple endocytic pathways are operational in a
metazoan cell. These may be broadly classified into Clathrin Dependent
(CD) or Clathrin Independent (CI) pathways. Given the existence of
multiple endocytic pathways, a cell is faced with the problem of
regulating endocytic flux through these pathways, in order to maintain a
proper coordination of membrane area, composition and shape. A cell can,
depending upon the circumstance, can either specifically or globally
regulate endocytosis. Although, these pathways differ in the type of cargo
internalized and the regulators involved, they also share a number of
common molecular players. A cell can therefore, change global endocytosis,
by modulating the activity of such common molecular players. For e.g.
Dynamin (a CD component) when acutely inhibited, up-regulates fluid phase
uptake via a Dynamin-independent, CI pathway called CLIC/GEEC (CG).
Conversely, Caveolin-1 a major component of another CI pathway called
Caveolar endocytosis, inhibits fluid phase uptake. Recent work in the
laboratory involving a RNAi screen to test for genes involved in CD and CG
pathways have shown many molecular players which are common to both
pathways. These up-regulate / down regulate both pathways, or show
opposite effects on these two pathways. This implies a complex
coordination network that connects these endocytic pathways.
I propose that one such potential co-regulator is c-Src (a non-receptor
tyrosine kinase family protein) for several reasons. Firstly, some of the
substrates of Src are hits in our screen; secondly, when trafficking from
the ER is activated, it leads to increase in the activation of c-Src
residing at the Golgi, and thirdly, c-Src also modulates the activity of
molecules like Dynamin, Clathrin heavy chain, Caveolin-1 etc which are
involved in regulating CD and CI endocytosis. Finally, c-Src is also known
to play a regulatory role in several cellular processes such as cell
migration, response to hypotonic shock wherein endocytosis is altered
spatially or temporally, respectively. In my seminar I will discuss the
effect of perturbing the activity of c-Src using mutants and
pharmacological inhibitors, on CD and CG as a starting basis to understand
coordination. <br> Expanded classification of DNA-binding Proteins and Genome-wide
 survey of DNA-binding proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana </br><br>The precise interactions between nucleic acids and proteins drive almost
every cellular process. DNA binding proteins regulate genetic activity
such as transcription, DNA rearrangement, replication and repair. In order
to examine the nature of these interactions, we had earlier revisited the
classification of DNA binding proteins (Thornton, 2000) from a protein
structure-centric perspective leading to the realisation of nine groups
and 174 families for protein-DNA complexes (*Malhotra and Sowdhamini,
2012). Groups are defined based on the type of DNA-binding motif present
in the protein partner and family reflects its biological function in the
cell.
Apart from organizing the existing protein-DNA complexes into
structure-based groups and families, I have next explored the sequence
families of DNA-binding proteins from the Protein Family database (Pfam)
leading to 1078 such protein families. A genome-wide survey was performed
in Arabidopsis thaliana on the basis of the structure and sequence based
classifications. Functional analysis of these gene products, after careful
validations, showed higher representation of DNA-repair proteins in
Arabidopsis. We also analyzed the mapping of these PFam families onto the 
structures in PDB. Related PFam families without any three-dimensional
structure mapping were clustered together.
I will be presenting an overview of the classification we are proposing
and the results of the genome wide survey.

 nerii'' </br><br>Flying insects use different sensory cues to control their flight. Visual
cues play a vital role in flight control among diurnal insects. Visual
processing in nocturnal insects is much slower than in diurnal
insects. This may result in nocturnal insects relying predominantly on
other sensory cues like mechanosensory cues. Antennal mechanosensors have
been shown to play a vital role in flight control in _Manduca sexta_ (a
crepescular/nocturnal hawkmoth). The mechanism by which antennal
mechanosensory input is used in flight control is not known.
My current project's aim is to study integration of antennal
mechanosensory input and visual input in _Daphnis nerii_ (locally found
crepescular/nocturnal hawkmoth). I specifically aim to identify and
characterize neurons which convey the antennal mechanosensory input and
visual input to flight motor neurons. In this AWS I will be presenting my
work done in the past year which are mainly developing and characterizing
tools and methods necessary for the project. I will also present a few
pilot experiments. <br> Understanding function of Phospholipase D (dPld) using Drosophilaphototransduction as a model system </br><br><p>Phospholipids play a key role in mediating signal transduction events and<br />intracellular membrane trafï¬cking. Phosphatidic acid (PA) is one<br />such phospholipid that is proposed to regulate both signal transduction as<br />well as membrane trafficking. PA can be generated in cells by a number of<br />different enzymes, one of which is phospholipase D (PLD). PLD hydrolyses<br />phosphatidylcholine (PC) to generate membrane-bound PA and choline. PLD<br />has been implicated in regulation of intracellular trafï¬cking,<br />cytoskeletal alterations and growth control pathways and PA generated by<br />PLD is proposed to regulate phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate<br />[PI(4,5)P2] resynthesis. Drosophila melanogaster has a single gene<br />(CG12110, dPld) encoding PLD activity. PA is a key intermediate in the<br />phototransduction cascade and mutants in enzymes that regulate<br />photoreceptor PA levels have profound effects on photoreceptor structure<br />and function. PLD loss of function mutant flies show light dependent<br />retinal degeneration. However the trigger and mechanism of retinal<br />degeneration remains unknown. In this seminar I will be presenting, the<br />work which I have been doing to understand the biochemical trigger of<br />retinal degeneration in loss of function mutant PLD.</p> <br> Not Given </br><br>Not Given <br> Impact of primary microRNA tertiary structure on the splicing of
 its host gene. </br><br>The majority of human microRNAs are located in intronic regions of the
genome and are transcribed by RNA Polymerase II. Primary microRNA
transcripts are processed first by Drosha to give ~70nt pre-miRNAs and
then by Dicer to generate ~22nt mature microRNAs that then regulate gene
expression. Efficient and accurate mRNA biogenesis however, is achieved
through coupling of Pol II mediated transcription with RNA Splicing.
Further, recent studies indicate that intron cleavage by Drosha has no
significant effect on mature mRNA production. Intronic miRNAs are
processed from unspliced intronic regions wherein the Microprocessor
complex can cleave the miRNA between splicing commitment step and the
excision step. This suggests that a continuous intron is not required for
splicing and that the exons of nascent RNAs remain associated with the CTD
of Pol II which acts as landing pad for processing factors until the
complete spliceosome assembly.
Exon tethering during splicing of intronic pre-miRNAs indicate a kinetic
dependence between miRNA processing and intron splicing. My studies have
shown that the tertiary structure of the pri-miR-17~92 poses a kinetic
barrier to its processing into precursor miRNAs. I am now trying to
investigate whether this structure also influences the splicing of its
host transcription unit, the C13orf25 also referred as MIR17HG. The
C13orf25 formed from human genomic locus on Chr13 is upregulated in
B-lymphomas and is known to undergo alternative splicing to give two
variants. In this AWS, I will discuss my approach to address whether
intronic miRNAs can act as regulatory elements for the splicing of their
host genes. <br> I-Switch in C. elegans: The switch goes neuronal </br><br>Neurons are characterized by their unique morphology and efficient sorting
and transport of cargo over long distances. However, even basic mechanisms
and cues regulating this transport, particularly from the synapse to the
cell body, is unknown. This dearth of information is predominantly due to
the lack of tools to access these retrogradely moving cargo-carrying
vesicles. My project is aimed at developing such a tool that combines ease
of accessibility of compartments with molecular programming, while
providing read-outs of functional cues of transport at the same time. My
previous work was focused on demonstrating the preservation of autonomous
functionality of such a pH sensitive DNA-based tool, called the I-switch,
in the model organism C. elegans1. Currently, using a combination of
genetic and biochemical strategies, I am trying to program the I-switch to
access retrogradely moving vesicles carrying the SNARE protein
synaptobrevin2 in specific populations of neurons. <br> Mate choice: curious case of Cynopterus sphinx </br><br>Mate choice is important factor influencing mating system. In mammals
females are the choosier sex as they invest more than males. Female mate
choice can be for direct (resources) or indirect (inbreeding avoidance,
good genes, genome compatibility) benefits. In this AWS I will discuss the
role of morphology, relatedness, heterozygosityand compatibility on mate
choice in short nosed fruit bat Cynopterus sphinx. This long-term study
using data from ten seasons on paternity reveals that the successful
mating pairs are significantly related. There is non- Mendelian
inheritance of genes in offspring for neutral markers suggesting the role
of post-zygotic mate choice. <br> Sequence design for a beta-trefoil folding-motif </br><br>The overall aim of our study is to design both the structure and the
sequence of a folding motif for the beta-trefoil fold. In earlier work
from our group the structure of such a motif was constructed by
identifying the positions of the C-alpha atoms (the backbone) and a set of
conserved pair-wise interactions between these atoms (the designed contact
map). The backbone was designed by choosing common structural features of
functionally diverse beta-trefoil proteins. Here, we outline a method to
design a sequence which fits this structure of the folding motif. In
sequence design, it is necessary to choose a sequence whose folded state
is not only thermodynamically stable but also kinetically accessible
(foldable). Foldability in natural proteins is a consequence of a funnel
shaped energy landscape. Foldability criteria such as cooperativity (the
protein folds in a single step) and efficiency (folding occurs on a
biologically reasonable timescale) are implicitly incorporated into the
native state contact map, in the framework of the energy landscape theory.
We use the native-state contact maps of wild-type beta-trefoil proteins to
design sequences for the folding-motif. The designed sequences are
determined by iteratively identifying residues from wild-type proteins
which satisfy the pair-wise interactions present in the previously
designed contact map. Several sequences are obtained which are further
screened based on solvent accessibility criteria, to ensure minimal
exposure of hydrophobic residues on the surface. Other criteria such as
solubility, secondary structure propensity, and aggregation propensity are
also considered. We are able to obtain a set of sequences which satisfy
these criteria and are significantly different from known natural proteins
in the protein data bank. In the future, we will synthesize and purify a
subset of these proteins in order to experimentally verify our method. <br> Identifying transcriptional targets of IP3R mediated Calcium
 signaling and Store Operated Calcium Entry in neurons of the
 developing flight circuit of Drosophila. </br><br>Inositol (1,4,5) Triphosphate(IP3R) is a secondary messenger that is
produced through phospho-inositide turnover in response to various
extracellular stimuli and mediates the release of intracellular calcium
via the IP3R (IP3Receptor) which plays an important role in controlling a
variety of Ca2+-dependent cellular functions. Mutation in the only gene
for IP3R in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster gives wing posture
defect and flight defect. This effect is mimicked by knocking down IP3R or
STIM, the calcium sensor on the ER specifically in the nervous system
indicating neuronal requirement for flight. The expression of IP3R is
critical in the nervous system in the initial stages of pupal development
which coincide with the time of metamorphosis of the flight motor neurons.
Thus, the role of IP3R and STIM as a cause of the observed phenotype is
well established, little is known about the cellular or molecular events
by which the phenotype is manifested. One of the most probable hypotheses
is that dynamic changes in intracellular Ca2+ levels either through IP3R
or store operated calcium entry (SOCE) can alter the frequency of Ca2+
spikes and thus duration of global Ca2+ transients affecting gene
transcription, as seen in non-excitable mammalian cells. The aim of my
project is to identify transcriptional changes that mediate the observed
phenotype.
In this annual work seminar, I will present my experiments from the past
year regarding the developmental requirement of dSTIM for correct flight
and the developmental expression profiles of ?the calcium tool kit? genes. <br> Identifying transcriptional targets of IP3R mediated Calcium

 strategies </br><br>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of mental
impairment and autism. It is caused by transcriptional silencing of the
fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene and the subsequent lack of the
fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Studies in the Fmr1-knockout
(KO) mouse, the prevailing model for the disease, have implicated
excessive signaling downstream of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors
(mGluRs) in the pathology of the disease. These findings have been
summarized as the ?mGluR theory? which has been a dominant concept in FXS
circles. This theory has opened avenues towards a potential reversal of
symptoms with drug intervention, specifically mGluR antagonists. Most of
the findings in the field, including the mGluR theory, come from studies
on the hippocampus, a brain region involved in the coding of factual
memories. FXS patients however, present with a prominent emotional
component including mood lability and high anxiety. This makes a case for
studying the amygdala, the brain region involved in processing emotions. 
My research interests therefore involve examining synaptic deficits in the
lateral amygdala (LA) of the mouse model and the effects of
pharmacological interventions on these defects. I will describe my work
demonstrating the reversal of pre- synaptic release probabilities at the
thalamic inputs to the LA in the KO by acute exposure of brain slices to
two potent mGluR-5 antagonists, MTEP and GRN-529. I have also found that
this rescue is not common to all inputs, since pre-synaptic release
probabilities at the cortical inputs to the LA are not reversed with
similar treatments. Further, I?ve studied the effect of chronic
administration of GRN-529 on defective synaptic plasticity in the LA of
the KO and found that LTP is rescued by this regimen. There is however, an
unexpected increase in spine densities in this region in KO animals
treated with GRN-529. To summarize, I will cover work that examines
contrasting effects of mGluR5-antagonists on synaptic phenotypes in the LA
of KO mice. <br> Role of InsP3-receptor function in neuronal Ca2+ homeostasis in
 context of neuro modulation and motor coordination </br><br>Genetic studies have revealed involvement of InsP3-receptor (IP3R)
function in motor coordination and neuro degenerative diseases. Mice KO
for type-1 IP3R, the major neuronal isoform in mammals, display severe
Spino-Cerebellar Ataxia (SCA) (Matsumoto et al., 1996), heterozygocity of
type-1 IP3R in human causes SCA15 (van de Leemput et. al., 2007). Reduced
function mutation or pan-neuronal knock down of IP3R in Drosophila results
in defects in flight and associated physiology (Banerjee et al., 2004;
Agrawal et al., 2010). IP3R mediated Ca2+ release contributes to cellular
function by activating a plethora of Ca2+ dependent signalling cascades
(Berridge, 1993), though how it contributes to neuronal physiology in
context of motor-coordination and behaviour is not well understood. Till
date most of the neuronal Ca2+ signals have been attributed to fast entry
of extracellular Ca2+ through voltage-operated channels or ionotropic
receptors (Spitzer NC, 2006). Hence it is possible that, in neurons, the
central and slow Ca2+ homeostasis modulated by IP3R feeds back to the
peripheral and fast Ca2+ signals and thus facilitates neuronal functions.
I have been studying how IP3R mediated Ca2+ release modulate intracellular
Ca2+ homeostasis in neuron by focusing on another slow Ca2+ entry pathway
called store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). SOCE gets activated upon
depletion of ER store Ca2+ and occur downstream of IP3R function in
Drosophila neurons (Venkiteswaran and Hasan, 2009). Genetic and Ca2+
imaging data suggest that IP3R function modulate SOCE in an allele
specific manner. This regulation is independent of store-Ca2+ depletion
and may involve partners of the ?Ca2+ toolkit? in the cytoplasm. I am also
looking at how IP3R function and SOCE is linked to neuronal spontaneous
Ca2+ spikes, a fast Ca2+ signal that arise from PM Ca2+ channels and
contribute to specification of neurotransmitter and formation of neuronal
circuits (Spitzer NC, 2006). <br> Organizational and developmental analysis of gustatory motor
neurons: birth order, lineage and targeting. </br><br>The taste or gustatory system of an organism is crucial for detecting
food, communication and laying eggs. Gustatory circuits of insects and
human share the similar fundamental principles of organization. Fruit
fly, Drosophila melanogaster, receives gustatory information from the
environment via sensory neurons and then to the ganglions where
interneurons process this information and feed into highre centres or to
motor neurons for appropriate behavioral response.
The sensory neurons of this circuit are well studied, but very little is
known about other components i.e. the motor neurons and the interneurons.
The main objective of this project is to characterize the organization,
birth order and dendritic arborization of motor neurons and their target
muscles. The cell bodies and dendrites of Drosophila motor neurons lie in
the central brain and their axonal terminals innervate the muscles of the
proboscis. We are tracing the projections of each motor neuron and study
their position in the brain; we also trace the position of their
dendritic arbors and their axonal targeting to the specific muscles of the
proboscis. This study will provide an anatomical map of motor output in
the taste circuit and will elucidate development of individual circuit
elements. <br> Not given </br><br>Not given <br> Understanding the role of GPI anchor in the plasma membrane
 organization of GPI anchored Proteins (GPI-APs) </br><br>Many eukaryotic proteins are anchored to the plasma membrane via a
glycolipid moiety called GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol) anchor.
Several lines of evidence suggest an important role for GPI anchor in the
membrane organization of its associated proteins. Previous studies have
shown that GPI-APs are organized as nanoscale clusters on the plasma
membrane (1, 2). These nanoclusters in turn are dependent on lipid
composition, cholesterol and underlying cortical actin activity (3). To
unravel the structural role of GPI anchor in the membrane organization of
GPI-APs, we have synthesized fluorescently tagged GPI analogues with
varying lipid tail and glycan core structure. In my talk I will provide
experimental evidence suggesting that the GPI anchor with long saturated
lipid tails and not the glycan head group is important for the membrane
organization of GPI-APs. Further in conjunction with results from
molecular dynamic simulations we hypothesize a transbilayer coupling
mechanism where in GPI-APs in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane
interacts with underlying cortical actin via lipid tail interactions with
inner leaflet lipids.

community in a sky island complex reveals differential impacts of island
structure on population structure </br><br>Sky island systems provide an excellent opportunity to study species
distributions with the effects of isolation and connectivity, resulting
from the interactions between topography and paleo-climate. In such
systems, breaks in mountain ranges cause vicariance (isolation), while
paleo-climatic changes cause changes in dispersal (connectivity) between
populations. We previously studied a montane forest species in the Western
Ghats sky islands that revealed deep phylogenetic breaks at ancient
geographic divides, and population divergence roughly corresponded to
paleo-climatic events. We proposed to examine if this paradigm was
consistent for several montane species in this system. We sampled almost
the entire understory bird
community from the Shola habitat (matrix of natural forests and
grasslands) from all six major ?islands? in the Western Ghats sky island
complex, covering most of the endemic species? range. Mitochondrial
Cytochrome-b sequences (~1.2kb, 253 samples, 21 species) were assembled
using standard primers. Maximum likelihood trees revealed a deep
divergence for several endemic species across ancient geographic divides.
There is evidence for cryptic speciation and possible delimitation of new
species.
Phylogeographic signatures were stronger and divergences deeper for
montane forest and grassland specialist species. Correspondingly,
widespread and migratory birds(both long-distance and elevational) showed
less phylogeographic structure. Our study is the first of its kind in this
biodiversity hotspot, and provides evidence that species ecology and
behavior may interact with processes like vicariance and dispersal to
drive evolution across such a landscape. <br> Structural Basis for anti-recombination activity of MutS2 </br><br>Genomic plasticity allows prokaryotic organisms to survive in dynamic and
stressful environments through presentation of multiple genomic templates
that can be subjected to natural selection. Point mutations, horizontal
gene transfer and intragenomic rearrangements can give rise to variability
in the genome. Homologous recombination is responsible for integration of
exogenous DNA and rearrangements within the genome. This process has to be
regulated so that genomic rearrangements do not occur at a frequency that
can compromise genetic viability. The MutS2 protein (Helicobacter pylori)
has been shown to inhibit homologous recombination and probably serves to
calibrate the frequency of genomic rearrangements. The protein belongs to
the MutS family but is not involved in DNA Mismatch Repair. MutS2 binds
recombination intermediates such as Holliday junctions with high affinity
through a N-terminal region and degrades these DNA structures through an
endonuclease domain (Smr) at the C-terminus. I aim to elucidate the
structural basis of specific recognition of recombination intermediates by
the MutS2 protein. In addition, I aim to shed light on the possible
allosteric mechanism by which the Smr domain is licensed to cleave DNA on
binding of the N-terminal region to cognate substrates. The study will
provide deep mechanistic insight into how MutS2 inhibits recombination.
The progress made in this direction will be presented. <br> Not given </br><br>Not given

Ecology and Evolution Journal Club <br> Role of intracellular Ca2+ signalling in development of
 Drosophila flight circuit and its activity during flight </br><br>Calcium is synonymous with a wide variety of cellular processes such as
gene transcription, signal transduction, neural excitability etc., which
could all potentially impact animal behaviour. Two key molecules of
interest in intracellular Ca2+ signalling are the endoplasmic reticulum
resident Ca2+ channel, inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) and
the ER calcium store depletion sensor, namely, stromal-interacting
molecule (STIM). A number of extracellular stimuli can activate IP3R
leading to the rapid release of Ca2+ from the ER stores. Subsequently,
store depletion is sensed by STIM which, with the help of plasma membrane
channel, ORAI and ER resident Ca2+ ATPase channels helps replenish the
stores - a process known as store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). In
Drosophila, mutants of IP3R show wing posture and flight defects. These
phenotypes are recapitulated upon pan neuronal down regulation of IP3R or
STIM, demonstrating a neuronal requirement of these genes. To further
dissect out the cellular basis for this phenotype, GAL4s specifying
different neuronal sub-populations have been tested.
My project aims to understand the neuronal basis of IP3R mediated Ca2+
signalling and SOCE in the development of the flight circuit and its
function during adult flight. In this annual work seminar, I shall present
strategies that I hope to employ to study this question and also present
some preliminary findings. <br> Reconstitution of short actin dynamics and its role in membrane
 organisation </br><br>A major aim of our work is to understand the mechanisms behind the
patterning of the plasma membrane. As reported previously,
glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored protein (GPI-AP) organisation into
nanoclusters in the plasma membrane is driven by the activity of cortical
actin (Goswami et al., 2008). A recent theoretical framework proposed by
Gowrishankar et al (2012) suggests the involvement of short actin
filaments whose engagement with the motor activity of myosins collaborate
to explain the unusual features of GPI-AP organization. Here, we aim to
reconstitute cortical actin dynamics in-vitro on supported lipid
bi-layers, which will allow us to explore the role of proteins thought to
be involved in actin-driven cluster formation in a controlled manner. This
system will allow us to develop quantitative tools to explore the
organisation of biological membranes at a high spatial and temporal
resolution, and make comparisons with theoretical models.

Cell 149 (June 2012) <br> Managing multiple mutualists: effects of herbivory on plant-fungi
 partnerships </br><br>Most land plants are associated with fungal mutualists such as arbuscular
mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) that colonize the roots and shoot-colonizing
endophytic fungi (EF). In return for carbon from the plant, these fungi
help the plant in a number of ways. AMF improve the host?s access to
nutrients such as phosphorous and nitrogen. EF have been shown to confer
services such as herbivory resistance and drought tolerance. Top-down
forces such as herbivory might drive changes in plant investment in its
mutualists, since some of the plant?s carbon is lost to grazing. Further,
competition for the same carbon pool suggests that AMF and EF are likely
to influence each other?s success in colonizing the plant. ?This would
lead us to predict that (a) carbon limitation under herbivory would result
in lower densities of AMF in plants in grazed regions (b) densities of
putative herbivory defense mutualists such as EF would go up in plants
under conditions of grazing, and (c) one fungal mutualist would limit the
density of the other in a host plant, since they compete for the same
carbon pool. In this presentation, I will discuss preliminary results from
a herbivore-exclusion experiment done to test the above predictions, set
in high altitude rangelands in the Trans-Himalayas. I will also outline
proposed field-based manipulative experiments to study the effect of
bottom-up forces of resource change due to warming and precipitation
changes on multiple fungal mutualists of plants <br> Role of voltage dependent Anion Channel-Hexokinase interaction in
 programmed cell death </br><br>The Voltage Dependent Anion-Selective Channel (VDAC) is the most abundant
protein of the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), plays a major role in
solute and metabolite (such as NAD+/NADH, ADP/ATP, succinate, citrate, and
ions like Ca2+) transport between cytosol and mitochondria and also it has
been shown that the VDAC is involved in the release of apoptogenic
proteins like cyt c via OMM. VDAC also forms a complex pathological
channel known as mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) which
is thought to be a complex of adenine nucleotide transporter (ANT) of
inner membrane, VDAC of outer membrane. VDACs from different sources show
varied primary sequence but conserved functional properties. In this AWS I
shall going to how hexokinase helps in the protection of cell death
induced by VDAC overexpression. <br> Endogenous autofluorescence as a novel marker for human pluripotent
 stem cells </br><br>Embryonic stem cells are one of the most important tools in regenerative
medicine. Since they can both differentiate into all cell types and also
can self renew, it becomes crucial to be able to identify the pluripotent
stem cells from their differentiating counterparts. Current methods to
identify pluripotent stem cells include immunostaining and expression of
exogenous markers driven by promoters of pluripotent genes. Both methods
have major drawbacks.
We report the identification of an alternative method- endogenous
autofluorescence, which is specific to undifferentiated human pluripotent
stem cells. Human pluripotent cells exhibit significant blue fluorescence
which correlates with the expression of endogenous pluripotency genes.
This property could be used to isolate single pluripotent cells away from
their differentiated counterparts by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting
and subsequently expanded.
The fluorescence also appears early in the reprogramming of human somatic
cells and disappears when the pluripotent stem cells differentiate. The
fluorescence emanates from lipid bodies which seem specific to human
pluripotent stem cells and is absent in mouse ES cells under typical
culture conditions. Our initial observations also suggest that the
endogenous autofluorescence may be specific for the epiblast state. <br> Role of horizontally acquired genes in gene expression regulation
 of *E.coli* -K12 MG1655 </br><br>Horizontally acquired genes play a major role in evolution of bacteria.
The well studied lateral gene transfer mechanisms include conjugation,
transformation and transduction (viral mediated). Integration of viral DNA
in host bacterium forms the prophage. Overtime some of these prophages
lose its ability to form active virions and forms ?cryptic prophages?.
These genetic elements helps the bacterium to cope the stress
(antibiotics, osmotic stress etc..) and thereby provides evolutionary
success to the organism that it resides in. Hence understanding the
mechanisms of how these horizontally acquired genes regulates the host's
gene expression is important. However, at this moment this remains
unclear, even in the well known model system *E.coli. *
Rac is one of the nine cryptic prophages in *E.coli*-K12 and has 29 genes
(23kbp in length). Deletion of *racR ? *a putative DNA binding protein ?*
*from this prophage* *is lethal, however the entire prophage can be
deleted. My study aims to reveal the molecular basis of the observed
phenotype. We hypothesized that *racR* could be the repressor of a toxin.
As a first step in understanding the mechanism underlying this process, my
preliminary results shows that there is indeed a putative toxin in the
prophage known as YdaS. However, the interaction (if any) between RacR and
*ydaS *is yet to be understood in detail. <br> Structural basis of target site recognition by Hes1 </br><br>Hes1 protein belongs to basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) super-
family of DNA-binding transcription factors. Hes1 is recognized as one of
the main effectors of activated notch signaling in mammals. This
transcription factor plays a critical role in development, differentiation
and tissue morphogenesis. Hes1 contains three functional domains- bHLH
domain, orange domain and C-terminal region. The bHLH domain of Hes1 can
bind with high specificity to quasi-palindromic sequences called N- and E-
boxes. The orange domain is predicted to adopt a unique fold and may play
a role in enhancing specificity and augmenting affinity of hHes1 towards
target DNA. Hes1 regulates transcription primarily by binding to N and E
boxes located in the promoter regions of target genes.? Using a
combination of structural, biochemical and biophysical tools, I aim to
unearth the structural basis of target site recognition by hHes1. The
progress made towards this end will be presented. <br> Virtual screening of inhibitors of the TLR-4 signaling pathway </br><br>The Toll-like receptor-4 belongs to the TLR family which recognises
pathogen-associated molecular patterns and plays a critical role in
regulating the innate immune system, especially in the early stages of
inflammation. The TLR-4 signaling pathway results in the production of
pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferon-&#946;. Upregulation of TLR-4
signaling can lead to sepsis and autoimmune disorders. Sepsis is a life
threatening condition whereby the body?s own organs are under attack by
the cells of the immune system, leading to multiple organ failure and
eventually death. Since TLR-4 is believed to be an important trigger for
the inflammatory response leading to sepsis, it has been a potential
therapeutic target for many researchers. However, not many drugs have been
effective at inhibiting sepsis to a substantial extent. Most drugs are
designed to target the extracellular domain of the TLR-4 receptor. Thus,
there is a need to design novel inhibitors specific to the TLR-4 signaling
pathway, without adversely affecting other signaling pathways. In this
AWS, I will explain how I intend to perform virtual screening of novel
small molecule inhibitors of the TLR-4 signaling pathway through modelling
and docking studies of the proteins involved in the TLR-4 pathway. These
small molecules will further be tested to see if they show any effect of
inhibition on the signaling pathway. <br> Structural and mechanistic studies of the mouse prion protein
 aggregation kinetics </br><br>The formation of amyloid aggregates by several proteins is linked with
several neurodegenerative (Prion diseases, Alzheimer?s diseases, Parkinson
diseases etc.) and non-neurodegenerative diseases (lysozyme amyloidosis,
type II diabetes etc.).Prion is a GPI-anchored protein present
ubiquitously in the brain cells of mammals.The autocatalytic conversion of
the cellular prion protein, PrPC, into the misfolded and aggregated form,
PrPSc, is linked to several fatal neurodegenerative diseases.While PrPC is
monomeric, highly soluble, proteinase K sensitive and alpha-rich form,
PrPSc is multimeric, insoluble, proteinase K resistant and beta-rich form.
The structure of PrPC is known from NMR studies to consist of an
unstructured N-terminal domain and a structured C-terminal domain
comprising 3 alpha-helices and 2 short beta strands, but the structure of
PrPSc is still poorly understood. The mechanism of conversion of PrPC into
PrPSc is also not well understood. Understanding the mechanism of the
conversion of PrPC into PrPSc, in both kinetic and structural terms, is an
important goal in prion biology for understanding the molecular basis of
prion pathogenesis.
In this AWS, I?ll talk about the structural studies of the putative toxic
oligomers and worm-like fibrils formed by mouse prion protein (moPrP) at
low pH. I will also show the sequence of the structural events involved
during conformational conversion of moPrP to amyloid fibrils at
physiological pH. Finally, I will discuss the mechanism involved during
this conformational conversion of moPrP to amyloid fibrils. <br> Normal mode analysis and molecular dynamics of prolyl
 oligopeptidase: role of interdomain dynamics reflecting substrate
 gating mechanism </br><br>Prolyl oligopeptidases (POP) are unique serine proteases which can cleave
only short peptides, specifically at the carboxyl terminal of internal
proline residues. These proteolytic enzymes are widely distributed in all
the three kingdoms of life, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes.
Human POP is a cytosolic enzyme and found to be associated with
degradation of peptides and hormones. Several mechanisms have been
proposed to study the passage of substrate entry in POP: one of the
mechanisms suggested the propeller acts as a gating filter, allowing only
small peptides to enter the cavity. It is also proposed that the motions
of two domains are required for substrate to reach the active site.
Recently, crystal structure of bacterial POP was obtained in two distinct
states, the open state which is in the absence of inhibitor and the closed
state is in the presence of inhibitor. This led to clearer understanding
of substrate entry in bacterial POPs. For eukaryotic POPs, none of the
crystal structure is obtained in ?open? state, raising the question of
difference in ligand access pathway in eukaryotes.
In this AWS, I will be talking about our attempts to understand the
motions of POP using normal mode analysis (NMA) and molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations. Motions observed using normal modes were analyzed in
detail atomistically by studying dynamics of protein. Like bacterial POPs,
opening of two domains was found to be a possible pathway for the
substrate gating in eukaryotes. Significant movements observed during NMA
include the movements of interdomain loop which was highly flexible,
mobility of N-terminal segment of alpha/beta hydrolase (which was found to
be involved in twist movement of propeller and hydrolase domain) and the
increase in beta-propeller pore size. Like bacterial POP, porcine POP
sequence, if threaded on the open form, is also proposed to adopt domain
closing motion. <br> As time goes by: the gradual effects of stress on the hippocampus </br><br>The hippocampus plays an important role in the formation of declarative
and episodic memories in the brain. Over the past several decades the
molecular and synaptic basis of hippocampal memories has been elucidated
in considerable detail. Interestingly, the same plasticity mechanisms that
enable hippocampal neurons to encode memories also make it vulnerable to
insult. Accumulating evidence suggests that severe and prolonged stress
can have detrimental effects on hippocampal structure and function that
impair learning and memory and other cognitive processes. For instance,
earlier research using rodent models of chronic or repeated stress has
shown that it causes dendritic atrophy and impaired synaptic plasticity in
the hippocampus, as well as deficits in learning and memory. But a
majority of these studies have measured the impact after the stress has
ended. Relatively little is known about how hippocampal structure and
function is affected as stress happens over time, i.e. how the various
effects are manifested during the course of chronic stress. Hence, I will
present data gathered from a series of studies that combined behavioral
and in vivo neuroimaging techniques to analyze the temporal progression of
the impact of 10 days of chronic immobilization stress on rats. <br> A role for the IP3 receptor in coupling growth to nutrition during
 Drosophila larval development </br><br>Drosophila melanogaster undergoes distinct stages of development which are
broadly characterized as: embryonic, larval, pupal and finally, adult. At
each stage, nutritional and environmental cues are integrated with
physiology to ensure healthy growth. We observe that a mutant of the
Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor (itpr) is unable to transition
normally from larvae to adult, when exposed to nutrient deprived media in
the final larval stage. To understand this phenomenon, three lines of
investigations are being pursued: 1) the sensitivity of the mutant to
different nutrients (sugar, amino acids and fatty acids); 2) identifying
the organ/ tissue where a knockdown or over-expression of itpr phenocopies
or rescues nutritional sensitivity; 3) probing the molecular basis for the
nutritional sensitivity exhibited by the itpr mutant. <br> Design and synthesis of a targetable, ratiometric, DNA based
 superoxide sensor. </br><br>Superoxide (O2.-) and the other reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from
superoxide are thought to play important roles in numerous
pathophysiologycal conditions like phagocytosis, apoptosis etc. However
there are very few tools available to probe superoxide concentration
inside cells quantitatively. So far, superoxide dependent oxidation of
Hydroethidium (a reduced product of ethidium bromide) is the most reliable
assay to sense superoxide in cells. However, this methodology has
limitations such as it is not ratiometric, and therefore not quantitative.
Further it suffers from lack of general targeting strategy to different
organelles, and therefore the roles of superoxide in cellular compartments
(except for mitochondria) are impossible to probe by live imaging. The DNA
scaffold offers selective advantages like ease of conjugation of different
types of dyes and highly specific cellular targeting methods being
developed by our group. We aim to make a targetable, ratiometric
superoxide sensor based on programmed DNA scaffolds to quantitatively
measure intracellular superoxide in a variety of intracellular locations.
In my AWS, I will describe some initial attempts of making a DNA
conjugatable superoxide sensor. <br> Sensory Representation in the Hippocampal CA1 cells </br><br>The mammalian hippocampus is considered important in the formation of new
memories about experienced events (episodic or autobiographical memory),
general declarative memory (memories that can be explicitly verbalized),
spatial memory and navigation, and associations between stimuli that are 
distinct in time, among other functions. To achieve this, the Hippocampus
must integrate information from different sensory areas of the cortex. I
am studying the representations of various stimuli in the mouse
hippocampus. For this, I use Two-Photon Calcium Imaging to measure the
activity of a relatively large number of hippocampal CA1 cells (~70-80)
and study network-level phenomena. In this AWS, I shall discuss some early
spontaneous activity measurements and propose a behavioral training
paradigm where the attention of the animal is ensured. An understanding of
stimulus representation could provide a basic framework to understanding
the mechanisms followed when hippocampus dependent associations are made. <br> Watching the Hippocampus Learn Using 2-Photon Imaging in Awake Mice </br><br>The mammalian hippocampus is known to be involved in declarative memory
formation and navigation. We examined its role in temporal memory
formation. Mice were trained on the trace eyeblink (hippocampus-dependent)
task, where they learn to associate two stimuli separated in time.
Hippocampal CA1-cell population activity was simultaneously monitored
using /in vivo/, awake 2-Photon Imaging. We found that during training,
CA1 cells gradually tune their responses to map out time. Time-tuned
responsiveness peaks at around the same time as behavioural
responsiveness. Furthermore, we observed pair-wise cell activity
correlations that indicate training-dependent changes in network dynamics,
yielding insight into how this time-tuned activity might emerge. <br> Reprogramming the cell cycle during the generation of induced
 pluripotent stem cells (iPS) </br><br>Embryonic stem cells (ES) have the unique capacity to indefinitely self
renew and the potential to differentiate into most somatic cell types.
Similar potency can be achieved by reprogramming somatic cells into
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS). Many of the underlying networks have
been unravelled but several crucial questions still remain.
One of the key questions concerns the regulation of the cell cycle in ES
cells which does not exhibit the classic cell cycle that was elucidated in
somatic cells. In ES cells the gap phases between the S-phase and M-phase
are highly reduced. By contrast a somatic cell exhibits two prominent gap
phases G1 and G2 where the influence of extrinsic signals and intrinsic
checkpoints are integrated. In addition key regulators of the cell cycle
behave distinctly: the cyclins whose discovery was based on their
oscillating expression by and large show no oscillatory expression in ES
cells. During reprogramming the cell cycle of somatic cells must be
dismantled and replaced by the ES type of cell cycle necessitating large
scale changes in the regulatory networks. The mechanism by which this
occurs is not well understood.
To probe the process of cell cycle alteration during reprogramming, I have
devised a tool based on inducible expression of the reprogramming factors.
Using estrogen receptor binding domain fusions to create a ?Reprogramming
Switch? I plan to induce reprogramming in a synchronous fashion to study
the sequential changes. In this AWS, I will present my progress towards
construction of this vector and deployment of a lentiviral construct that
should permit analysis of the cell cycle as well as elucidate the role
that the Yamanaka factors may play in this process.
? <br> &#945;-Synuclein protein aggregation </br><br>The aggregation of &#945;-synuclein is known to be implicated in
Parkinson?s disease, which is the second most common neurodegenerative
disease. Structurally, the &#945;-synuclein is an intrinsically disordered
protein. Its aggregation follows Nucleation dependent polymerization
mechanism and it forms &#946;-sheet rich amyloid fibrils. Aggregation
kinetics of &#945;-synuclein protein is known to be very sensitive to
aggregation condition, sample handling and potential surface-binding
artifacts. Irreproducibility in aggregation kinetics is the reason for the
lack of understanding regarding the aggregated cytotoxic species. In the
present study, we are trying to get reproducible aggregation kinetics
which is required for structural and morphological characterization of the
aggregated species.
In this AWS, I will talk about the purification, characterization and
aggregation of &#945;-synuclein protein. Various buffer conditions have
been tried for reproducibility, and a condition which was yielded maximum
reproducibility has been further investigated. <br> ER Ca2+ store depletion and STIM protein puncta formation in
 Drosophila primary neuronal culture </br><br>Neuronal Ca2+ homeostasis and Ca2+ signaling regulate multiple fundamental
neuronal functions and dysregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis is involved in
pathogenetic mechanisms of various neurodegenerative diseases.
Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) is a ubiquitous signaling mechanism in
mammalian cells that is triggered by a reduction in the level of Ca2+ in
intracellular stores. Two protein families were identified as being
essential for SOCE activation: STIM as an ER Ca2+ sensor and ORAI as a
Ca2+ channel in the plasma membrane. Experience suggests that the activity
of Drosophila Orai and STIM proteins are essential for normal flight and
associated patterns of rhythmic firing of the Drosophila melanogaster
motorneurons. Moreover, the over-expression of either STIM or Orai
proteins in InsP3 receptor mutant neurons can significantly restore SOCE
and can suppress flight defects to various extents.
My project is focused on examining STIM clustering profile upon ER store
depletion in Drosophila primary neurons and testing whether it is mediated
via InsP3R signaling pathway. We found that distribution of over-expressed
STIM-YFP proteins in Drosophila primary neurons significantly changes into
discrete punctate structures after ER Ca2+ store depletion. Besides, this
effect was more pronounced in neuronal sub-domains, e.g. glutamategic and
peptidergic. Importantly, pan-neuronal knockdown of the InsP3 receptor
significantly decreased STIM puncta formation which suggests about its
essential role at the initial stage of SOCE in fly neurons. Further
experiments will lead to a deeper understanding the contribution of the
InsP3R to this Ca2+ signaling process. <br> Patterns of mammalian (rodent) species richness of mammals in the
 Himalayas </br><br>For long, contemporary climate was considered to be the main driver of
species richness patterns at the global scale. However, exploring patterns
at regional scales have indicated that historical factors (biogeographic
history and species history) also influence richness patterns at these
scales. Hence understanding diversity at regional scales is important to
understanding the factors influencing these patterns. The Himalayas are
one of the youngest and tallest mountain chains in the world and are the
result of the collision between the Indian and the Asian plates, about
55-40 Mya. The creation of this mountain chain led to drastic changes in
the climate and topography of the Asian landmass. Avifaunal studies have
shown that there are few endemics in the Himalayas, and many species have
invaded the Himalayas from adjoining regions. Our initial results of
rodent species richness patterns in the Himalayas also suggest low
endemism at the level of genera, raising questions about the origin of
mammalian diversity in the Himalayas. I will present some initial patterns
we have observed for the region, and some data from the recent fieldwork
conducted there. <br> Role of Myosins in nano-scale organisation of plasma membrane
 components </br><br>The cell membrane is a laterally inhomogeneous surface in terms of its
lipid and protein organisation. GPI anchored proteins and some model
transmembrane actin-binding proteins, present at the plasma membrane have
been shown to organise into domains on the plasma membrane. Our laboratory
has shown that actin filament dynamics driven by a blebistatin-inhibitable
activity (consistent with a contractile myosin motor , possibly Myosin II)
is important for driving the organisation of GPI anchored proteins in
cholesterol sensitive nanoclusters (1). Furthermore, a recent theoretical
framework proposed by Gowrishankar et al., (2) illustrates the need for
myosin motors in orienting and driving short actin filaments into small
scale remodelling asters, which in turn create nano-clusters of components
associated with the filaments.
My objective is to investigate the role of myosins in driving nanoclusters
of these membrane components. Myosins are actin-based motors and the
superfamily can be divided into at least 20 different classes (3).
Therefore a key questions would be to address the kinds of myosinsinvolved
in this kind of membrane organization activity. Classes of myosins that
couple closely with the plasma membrane and the actin meshwork are likely
to be of particular relevance.I am going to present results on the role of
an unconventional myosin that can bind cell adhesion molecules such as
Integrins and to phosphoinositides on the inner leaflet of the plasma
membrane.

 evaluation of domain architecture comparison algorithm </br><br>Protein domain architecture refers to the composition and order of
different or identical domains arranged in a protein. Proteins domains are
tinkered by nature to perform plethora of functions, despite limited
number of available domain folds. Conservation of these domain
architectures preserves their functions across species, whereas varying
them allows a basic catalytic machinery to be used in diverse biological
processes. Protein domains are organized into different hierarchies like
domain, family, superfamily, fold, class as recorded in the SCOP database.
In the current study, we focus on superfamily-level classification of
protein domains and their architectures. To obtain a dataset for domain
architectures across different species, we devise a sequence search
strategy to obtain homologous sequences. In this process, homologous
sequences are classified based on their source and are organized into a
database named GenDis. Domain architectures can then be deduced for all
such related protein sequences. ADASS, a domain-architecture-based
algorithm earlier developed in the lab, will be implemented to compare
similarities within such domain superfamiles. In this talk, I will
elaborate on evaluation of the sequence search strategy and its comparison
with different homology detection tools. I will explain the implementation
of the sequence search strategy in updating the GenDis database. I will
then discuss about evaluation of scoring scheme for ADASS algorithm and
future strategies for its improvement. <br> Studying the molecular correlates of stress associated neuronal
 plasticity </br><br>Stress alters normal human behavior and stress response is the array of
physiological changes that the body incurs to retain homeostasis. Imaging
studies have implicated the hippocampus and the basolateral amygdala (BLA)
associated with stress (1). Studies from our lab and other groups have
shown that repetitive or chronic stress leads to neuronal atrophy in the
hippocampus, while the same stress is responsible for hypertrophy in the
BLA (2).
At the molecular level, not much is known about the factors leading to the
contrasting effects of stress on the hippocampus and the amygdala. Young?s
group, along with our lab has shown that Lithium can block the amygdala
hypertrophy and the hippocampal atrophy at the same time (3). This study
indicates a common link between the two mentioned brain areas. Lithium is
known to inhibit GSK3-&#946; which is major molecule in the Wnt pathway.
The Wnt pathway is a classical pathway known to play a major role in
neuronal development and maintenance. Its role in axon guidance, dendritic
growth and spine formation is well documented (4). The stress induced
hypertrophy seen in the amygdala is very similar to a developing brain.
Also, Wnt levels are known to be altered in various psychiatric illnesses
and certain antidepressants are known to act on the Wnt pathway. All the
above observations together hint the role of Wnt signaling pathway in
stress associated neuronal plasticity. We have observed that the canonical
Wnt pathway is up regulated in the BLA after chronic stress, while the
levels of Wnt7a and active &#946;-Catenin remain unchanged in the CA3
region of the hippocampus. The next phase of experiments are targeted to
block the Wnt pathway in the BLA during chronic stress to associate the
role of Wnt in stress related neuronal plasticity.
Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is another molecule associated
with neuronal plasticity. A study from our lab has demonstrated that
levels of total BDNF are up regulated in the BLA while are down regulated
in the CA3 region of the hippocampus after chronic stress (5). It is known
that BDNF is regulated at the transcriptional level and DNA methylation
plays an important role in doing so. To understand the regulation of BDNF
in chronic stress, I have looked at the levels of three important BDNF
exons in the BLA during chronic stress.
In this AWS I will be presenting data on the role of Wnt signaling pathway
& the regulation of BDNF in chronic stress.

world rice production is rain-fed. The production of rice is majorly
effected by environmental factors and most deleterious abiotic stresses
being Salinity and Drought. Since root is theonly organ for nutrient and
water uptake, hence is directly affected by these stresses. Both of these
stress conditions pose water deficit situations for plants, salinity being
due to high content of salt in the soil water and drought being low water
availability. Previous studies have shown that the development of root
hydrophobic barriers in rice limit the water and Na+ ion uptake following
salt stress, which in turn helped in maintaining the hydraulic balance and
negating the toxic effects ofNa+ ions. Furthermore, these barriers are
considered as one of the reasons for a rice variety (Pokkali) to be salt
tolerant. On the other hand, limiting water uptake due to hydrophobic
barriers could be deleterious in drought conditions.
Though salinity and drought are two different abiotic stresses, yet
drought can be considered asone of the manifestations of salt stress. This
study is taken up to investigate the responses of roots when exposed to
drought and salinity, thus to compare the effects of drought with that of
salinity in different varieties of rice plants, which would therefore
assist in understanding as to whether the responses to these stresses are
synergistic or mutually exclusive.
? <br> Functional properties of tumorigenic CD66 subpopulation in cervical
 cancer </br><br>A major area of concern in the cancer treatment is the tumour recurrence
after the apparent complete removal of cancerous cells by chemo-radio
therapy. This might be because of the subset of chemo-radio resistant
cells which have self renewal property. A cell within a tumor that possess
the capacity to self-renew and give rise to heterogeneous lineages of
cancer cells that comprise the tumor is considered as a tumour initiating
cell or a cancer stem cell(CSC). Ability of self renew and driving the
tumour progression, asymmetric cell division, chemo resistance,
quiescence, ability to metastasize , are some of the properties that have
been attributed to cancer stem cells.
Previous work from our lab suggests that CD66+ subset from primary human
cervical carcinomas and cervical cancer cell line has properties of CSCs
including enhanced tumorigenic potential, metastatic ability, and colony
formation. Moreover, these cells show enhanced Notch signalling which is
important for maintaining this subset (Bajaj et al; 2011).The unpublished
work by Chitra et al shows that CD66+ Notch1 high cells arise in early
cervical lesions and they allow HPV viral amplification allowing cellular
transformation.
The expression of CD66 co related with clinical outcome to an extent and
to make this prediction more accurate we are looking at heterogeneity
within CD66 cells using an additional marker CD49f. The addition of CD49f
into the study has also helped us to have a rough framework for cancer
stem cell hierarchy.CD66 - CD49f + cells express higher amounts of basal
cytokeratin and low amount of differentiation markers and these cells are
functionally more chemo resistant. (The basal layer of normal cervix where
the stem cells reside are also CD66- CD49f+).CD66+ CD49f+ cells are rarely
dividing, non quiescent and not terminally differentiated but arrested in
between Cell cycle. These cells also have higher levels of HPV viral E6
protein .(As cancer progresses cells in the middle layer of epidermis are
the first to express the both markers CD66 and CD49f and this is the same
region where HPV amplification happens and HPV can arrest the host cell
division.)CD66+ CD49f- cells express lower amounts of basal cytokeratin
and higher amount of S100P and involucrin. Functionally these cells are
the migratory cells. (In normal cervix the differentiated top layer of
cells are CD66+ CD49f-). <br> Thermodynamic Characterization of the Unfolding of the Prion
 Protein: Evidence for Conformational Flexibility of the Native 
State </br><br>The native prion protein appears to be unusually susceptible to
conformational changes, and unlike nearly all other proteins, can easily
be made to convert to alternative misfolded disease associated
conformations. To understand the basis of this structural plasticity, an
understanding of the molecular forces and interactions maintaining the
integrity of native structure is important. In this study a detailed
thermodynamic characterization of two variants of the mouse prion protein,
the full length moPrP (23-231) and the structured C-terminal domain (CTD),
moPrP (121-231), has been carried out. Precise values of thermodynamic
parameters maintaining the native prion structure have been obtained. The
results indicate that the native prion protein undergo high levels of
structural fluctuations and sample less compact structures which are more
accessible to solvent. This is indicative of a highly malleable,
structurally plastic native state suggesting why the native prion protein
is so susceptible to conversion to different aggregation prone structures.
In my talk, in addition to the above results, I would discuss future
experiments designed so as to observe and characterize such solvent
accessible conformations in the wild type prion protein and the changes in
their population in disease associated mutant prion proteins. I would also
discuss experiments monitoring conformational conversion of the native
prion protein to misfolded, toxic forms. <br> Role of serotonin in mammalian embryonic stem cells </br><br>The presence of serotonin in mouse pre-implantation embryos and its
colocalization with mitochondria has been shown by earlier work in the lab
(Basudha Basu et al. 2008). The same work also reported that exogenous
addition of serotonin to pre-implantation embryos, caused an increase in
mitochondrial potential. The presence of serotonin in mouse embryonic stem
cell extracts has also been reported (Walther et al., 1999). In my
previous work, I have shown the presence of serotonin in mouse embryonic
stem cells and its co-localization with mitochondria by dual
immuno-staining experiments. I have also shown that exogenous addition of
serotonin to mouse embryonic stem cells causes an increase in
mitochondrial potential while a decrease in the reactive oxygen species
(ROS) levels. The modulation of these two parameters of mitochondrial
metabolism by serotonin assumes importance in the light of various studies
which describe the importance of mitochondrial metabolism in embryonic
stem cells, both mouse and human (Stefan M. Schieke et al. 2008, S Varum
et al. 1999, Sudip Mandal et al. 2011).
Extending these studies to human pluripotent stem cells showed that
serotonin is present in these cells as well and ~50% of the serotonin is
localized to the mitochondria similar to mouse embryonic stem cells.
However, experiments to study the effect of serotonin on mitochondrial
potential and ROS levels in human embryonic stem cells have shown
differences (Wenyu Zhou et al. 2012). This may be reflective of the 
inherent differences in the mitochondria of these two cell types. I will
elaborate on these results in addition to preliminary results of
experiments done with human induced pluripotent cells (iPS). <br> Deciphering the role of inputs to motor-neurons in coordinated
 locomotion in Drosophila melanogaster </br><br>Animals move on flat and regular terrains, overcome barriers, irregular
terrains and unexpected perturbations. This kind of movement is achieved
by the mechanical properties of appendages and the action of specific
muscles by motor neurons.Motor neurons themselves are controlled by
pre-motor circuits whose role are relatively unexplored. Such inputs to
motor neurons can be from excitatory or inhibitory interneurons. Our aim
is to study the role of the excitatory and inhibitory inputs in the
regulation of coordinated walking. We do this not by altering pre-motor
neurons, but by altering neurotransmitter receptor in motor neurons.
Leg motor neurons are organized as a ?myotopic map?, which refers to the
correlation between the positioning of the dendrites of the MNs in the
central nervous system and its axonal innervation of specific target leg
muscles (Brierley et al, 2011). These motor neurons receive inputs from
interneurons that could be either excitatory or inhibitory in nature. To
study the role of these interneurons in maintaining leg coordination, we
knockdown the excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors on
motor neurons. Developmental knock down of excitatory glutamate receptors
and inhibitory GABA receptors on motor neurons results in defective
walking pattern.Further, we are analyzing if these inputs are required
early in development for maturation of motor circuit and if these genetic
perturbations cause anatomical changes in motor neurons. <br> RNA Polymerase II pausing in Quiescent Myoblasts. </br><br>Transcriptional control of gene expression was long considered to be
focused primarily at the level of initiation, where recruitment of RNA
polymerase by tissue-specific or temporally regulated transcription
factors was the rate-limiting step. Recently, promoter-proximal pausing of
engaged RNA pol II (pol2) has emerged as a genome-wide control mechanism
for coordinated regulation of developmental or cell state transitions. In
the context of stem cells, this pausing or stalling has been proposed to
play a role in poising the genome for the choice between alternate cell
fates. Cells traversing the cell cycle display a high level of global
transcription which is actively controlled, but quiescent cells have been
traditionally considered to possess low metabolic rates with minimal
genomic activity. Recent studies including results from our lab, suggest
that cells are actively reprogrammed in G0, and remain poised for
different cell fates in response to environmental cues. My interest is to
investigate whether pol2 pausing creates or maintains a transcriptionally
poised state in quiescent myoblasts.
My initial studies showed decreased levels of transcriptionally active RNA
pol2 in quiescent compared to cycling cells, consistent with decreased
total RNA content in G0. To investigate whether pol2 pausing is a feature
of reversible cell cycle arrest, I have used genome-wide ChIP-Seq
(chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing) for total
pol2, comparing three cellular states- proliferating, quiescent and
differentiated. The occupancy of pol2 for each state has been compared to
transcriptome profiles to correlate polymerase engagement with mRNA
levels. I will discuss the preliminary results in trends of pol2 occupancy
and their implications for different cellular states. <br> Characterization of structural transitions during protein
 unfolding under native-like conditions. </br><br>Unfolding studies are typically carried out under conditions of high
temperature, pressure or denaturant, which destabilize the native
structure and cause the protein to unfold.Under native-like conditions,
unfolding takes place through conformational changes which can populate
partially unfolded intermediates, but which are rare and transient and
hence difficult to characterize. The aim of the present work was to
populate and structurally characterize these intermediate forms. Thiol
labeling (SX) is a high resolutions probe, used to monitor solvent
accessibilities of cysteine side chains, located in different parts of the
small protein single chain monellin (MNEI), during unfolding. In this AWS,
I will be discussing the main results which provide an understanding of
how side chain packing interactions are lost and different parts of the
protein become exposed to the surrounding solvent as unfolding proceeds. <br> Mechanical linkages coordinate the movement of wings and halteres
 in flies </br><br>The remarkable success of insects was driven by the evolution of flight
and the miniaturization of their body size. However, to meet the
aerodynamic demands of flight, smaller insects must flap their wings at
substantially higher frequencies, often pushing the limits of
stroke-to-stroke nervous control. High wingbeat frequencies require rapid
control of flight and Dipteran hindwings have modified into sensory
structures called halteres that provide rapid feedback. Despite high
wingbeat frequencies, Dipteran insects have precise in-phase coordination
of wing movement and anti-phase coordination of the mechanosensory
halteres. How do insects meet the challenge of being both fast and precise
during flight? Using the black soldier fly, Hermetia illucens, we show
that the answer lies in the physical architecture of the thorax, which
includes a system of multiple, distributed mechanical linkages that
connect the wings and halteres. We systematically identify these links and
propose a mechanical model of the thorax. We discuss preliminary
experiments suggesting that wings and halteres might be analogous to
coupled oscillators. We also show this precise coordination of wings and
halteres is critical for stable flight. <br> The CLIC/GEEC endocytic pathway delivers Wingless to Frizzzled
 receptors in endosomes and sculpts a linear signalling gradient
 in the Drosophila wing disc </br><br>Wingless (Wg) is a Wnt family protein. It belongs to a class of secreted
morphogens responsible for patterning tissues in Drosophila and most
metazoans. Localized secretion of Wnts and their distribution in a spatial
gradient is a quantitative determinant of long range signalling, resulting
in robust tissue patterns. Binding of Wnts to a seven-pass trans-membrane
receptor family, Frizzled receptors (FzR) triggers signalling via the
stabilization of armadillo (&#61538;-catenin) inside the cell. Wnt-ligand
driven endocyosis of DFz2 by a clathrin and dynamin-dependent process has
been implicated in the modulation of Wg-signalling and the establishment
of the Wg-signalosome . We find that in the developing wing disc of
Drosophila, an Arf-sensitive, clathrin and dynamin-independent CLIC/GEEC
(CG) endocytic pathway is necessary for i) productive engagement of Wg
with DFz2, and ii) establishment of the exact shape of the signalling
gradient. At the cell surface of epithelial cells, Wg binds to
HSPG-decorated GPI-anchored proteins, Dally and Dlp, and is internalized
into the CG-pathway, whereas DFz2 is endocytosed via a clathrin-dependent
endocytic pathway. Perturbation of CG-mediated Wg endocytosis and
inhibition of its mixing with DFz2-carrying endosomes derived from the 
clathrin-dependent pathway inhibits signalling, both in the wing disc and
in a cell line-based assay. This inhibition also results in severe
patterning defects. In the endosome, Wg requires endosomal acidification
to associate with FzR, forming the Wg signalosome, thereby triggering
downstream signalling. Perturbation of endosomal acidification,
post-endocytosis inhibits Wg binding to DFz2 as revealed by a FRET-based
assay to detect the interaction of Wg with DFz2. The spatial modulation of
the CG pathway is necessary for sculpting the unusually linearly shaped Wg
intracellular (endosomal) gradient which in turn shapes the Wg
signalling gradient. These studies establish a physiological role for
this ubiquitous endocytic process where the CG pathway delivers Wg to the
Wg-signalosome ensuring another level of control on the gradient. <br> Self organization of nicotinic Acetylcholine receptor and actin
 dynamics. </br><br>The Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is a long-term surface resident
protein, and its localization and maintenance at synapses is important for
neuronal transmission. It is one of the best-characterized ligand-gated
ion channel, and its distribution in cells is proposed to be important for
synaptic plasticity.
My previous work shows that there is an increase in the src kinase
phosphorylation as well as Rac1 GTPase recruitment downstream of AChR
ligation. There is a change in cellular actin polymerization and a
quantitative increase in the amount of F-actin following AChR ligation.
Ligation of AChR leads to a dynamic and actively patterned state of actin
machinery, which is measurable using established tracking algorithms. This
dynamic activity is dependent on functional myosin II. AChR organization
on the plasma membrane is also an actin dependent process and can be
demonstrated by quantifying the surface AChR, before and after actin
cytoskeleton perturbation.
Here, I report findings suggesting that nAChR exhibits organization at the
supra-molecular scale; it occurs as optically resolvable dynamic
micron-scale clusters which are in turn composed of nanoscale clusters as
resolved by STED microscopy. These nanoscale clusters reorganize upon
cross-linking by monoclonal antibodies and by cholesterol depletion [3].
Using STED microscopy, I now show that the nanoscale clustering of the
nAChR at the cell surface is sensitive to perturbations of actin and
actin-interacting and actin-regulatory proteins such as cortactin and
&#61537;-actinin.
Furthermore nAChR ligation also locally affects membrane composition,
monitored by observing the distribution of nanoclusters of GPI-tethered
proteins (whose existence at the plasma membrane reflects underlying
actin-coupled membrane composition [4]). These observations suggest that
upon ligation, nAChR is capable of self-organizing its local membrane
environment by its intrinsic ability to engage with a dynamic actin
mechanics.

 species in the Western Ghats </br><br>Commensalism with humans has evolved in many animal species ever since the
Neolithic humans adopted a sedentary lifestyle. The change in resource
type, predation pressures and other selective regimes associated with the
transition from ?wild ? type? habitat to the commensal habitat is bound
to have an impact on the evolution of these animals. I wish to understand
these adaptive responses and their consequences on a human commensal,
Rattus rattus in comparison with its non ? commensal counterpart, Rattus
satarae in the Western Ghats. More specifically, I am interested in the
population genetics of these species and morphological traits associated
with the dietary aspects of commensalism. In this AWS, I will present
results of one year of sampling effort in different locations in the
Western Ghats. I will explore the population differentiation within the
two species across this landscape and present preliminary data on their
morphological variation. <br> Myoblasts switch from symmetric to asymmetric division under
 influence of epidermal Wnt and notch signaling. </br><br>Muscle is a multinucleated structure, formed by the contribution of cells
known as myoblasts. The process of muscle formation is well studied but
how small number of precursors divide to form large myoblast pool is
unknown. Understanding this phenomenon of myoblasts multiplication is
important as it would also answer the question, how myoblast gives
identity to muscles in terms of their shape, size and function. To address
this question we use adult flight muscles as model where muscles of
different size and function are formed from few progenitors known as adult
muscle progenitors (AMPs). These embryonic AMPs divide during larval
stages to from myoblasts pool. We hypothesize AMPs as the stem cells due
to their ability to form structurally and functionally different muscles.
And to answer how these stem cells divide we used various well-known
genetic techniques. Our results from the studies done so far reveals
symmetric and then asymmetric mode of division, which finally forms pool
of myoblasts. Like many well-known stem cell-niche contexts we found that
the underlying epidermis plays very important role in terms of
orchestrating these cell cycles by regulating Wnt and notch pathway. <br> Effect of chronic stress on fear memory generalization. </br><br>The hippocampus and the amygdala are two important brain regions involved
in declarative and emotional memories respectively. Various lines of
investigation have shown that chronic stress has contrasting effects on
these two areas. For example, chronic stress causes CA3 dendritic atrophy
and impairs long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus, while
inducing spinogenesis, dendritic hypertrophy and facilitating LTP in the
Basolateral amygdala (BLA). Accumulating evidence from both animal and
human studies also highlight the importance of the amygdala in stress
disorders. In addition, there is an extensive anatomical and functional
connection between the hippocampus and the amygdala. This connection is
particularly important as we observe increased synchronized activity
between the LA and the CA1 after fear conditioning. We are therefore
interested in looking at the effects of stress on the
hippocampal-amygdalar circuit and how it affects the synchrony established
across the lateral amygdala (LA) and CA1 region of the hippocampus after
fear conditioning.For doing so we have established a behavioural paradigm
to test stress induced effects on rat?s ability to discriminate between
safe and fearful stimuli.
Therefore rats were subjected to chronic immobilization stress (CIS)
paradigm followed by discriminative fear conditioning using two auditory
tones where one is paired to a foot shock (CS+) and the other remains
neutral (CS-). Next day the animals were presented with the same set of
fearful (CS+) and neutral (CS-)stimuli for testing the cue specific versus
non-specific fear memory, which was compared with the unstressed animals.
In my AWS I will talk about the initial behavioural results on stress
induced non-specific fear memory. <br> The effect of Pulsed Rainfall on Dry Forest Trees </br><br>One of the key predictions is that rainfall events will become more
unpredictable leading to more pulsed rainfall regimes in which longer
droughts will culminate in heavier rainfall events. This will create new
conditions that ecosystems will have to adapt to and this adaptation is
highly likely to involve a shift in plant communities. Hence this project
aims to investigate how tree communities in dry deciduous forests of India
may respond to these changes in rainfall patterns. A bottom up approach
has been chosen, which involves growing seedlings of species commonly
found in dry deciduous forests under three rainfall regimes (control,
small pulsed and large pulsed) and measuring growth and suite of other
physiological and structural functional traits. The ultimate goal is to
see if it is possible to predict which species will do well under more
pulsed regimes using these functional traits. I will be presenting data
from a preliminary experiment that I conducted to assess the feasibility
of this experiment. Overall it does seem to be a feasible experiment to
do on a larger scale and already some thought provoking results have been
obtained with some traits changing in predictable ways and others changing
in unexpected ways. <br> Sigma factor switching in the stationary phase of E.coli </br><br>Bacteria such as E.coli have multiple sigma factors that direct RNA
polymerase to transcribe specific sets of genes, depending on the
prevailing environmental conditions. In stationary phase in E.coli, the
primary sigma-70 factor is partly replaced by sigma-38, which directs
transcription of genes required for survival under stressful conditions. I
am studying the role of the 6S RNA and Rsd protein, both of which are
hypothesized to sequester sigma-70 and thereby assist the functioning of
sigma-38. For this, I am building an equilibrium model of the switch
between sigma factors in stationary phase. I have also made and
characterized knockouts of 6S RNA, Rsd and sigma-38 in E.coli and intend
to study their transcriptome. <br> Regulation of pre-synaptic vesicle transport by synapses </br><br>Neurons are composed of long, highly branched processes called axons and
dendrites. Axonal transport plays an important role in neuronal
development and maintenance. Important components of axonal transport are
molecular motors, tracks along which motors move and cargos. The
trafficking of cargos and motors to axon vs. dendrites in neurons is
thought to be dependent on cargo sorting at TGN, post translation
modifications and arrangement of the cytoskeleton. Within branched axons
it is not well understood if there are domains into which cargo are
preferentially transported. A major axonal cargo in neurons is known to be
synaptic vesicles. The aim of my thesis is to understand whether transport
of synaptic vesicles in branched axons is regulated or directed to certain
synapses/branches in comparison to others? Synaptic vesicles and active
zone protein precursors in neurons are delivered specifically at the
points of synaptic branch/synapse during development (1).We hypothesized a
possible mechanism that synapses/branches send signals and locally
regulate segregation or targeting of SVs such that the delivery of
synaptic vesicle proteins to synapses/branches is preferred.
To understand the role of synapses/branches in regulation of synaptic
vesicle transport, we adopted the approach of live imaging and genetics in
C. elegans. We observed that anterograde transport is modulated by the
presence and development of synapse. UNC-104/kinesin-3 is the major
anterograde motor protein required for synaptic vesicle transport.
Kinesin-3 motor mutant give indication to implicate the role of motors in
the regulation of directional transport. The mechanistic role of motors
and synapse in directional transport is very unclear. In my talk, I will
present very preliminary results on how the synapse and transport
machinery communicate to maintain the directed transport.

(2000) <br> Effects of immobilization stress on the medial prefrontal cortex of
 rats </br><br>Stress disrupts the normal homeostatic equilibrium of a living system, and
physiological responses to stress help an organism to deal with the
stressor and re-establish the equilibrium after the stressor ceases.
However, in cases where this equilibrium fails to get reinstated, it often
leads to pathological stress disorders. Using rodents as a model organism
to understand the effects of stress on the brain, past studies from our
lab have shown that ten day long chronic immobilization stress (CIS) in
rats can cause contrasting structural plasticity in the hippocampus and
the amygdala - the two principal brain regions that modulate the
neuroendocrine response to stress. For instance, while neurons in the
basolateral amygdala undergo dendritic hypertrophy and show an increase in
Brain Dereived Neurotrophic Factor, a neurotrophin, the hippocampal
pyramidal neurons undergo a dendritic atrophy along with a decrease in
BDNF. Like the hippocampus, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) also
exerts negative feedback regulation of the stress response. Thus, I aim to
look at the effects of stress on the mPFC, a brain region responsible for
higher executive functions that shares extensive anatomical connections
with the above mentioned regions. Using the 10 days CIS paradigm, I want
to understand the molecular and morphological changes caused by stress in
the mPFC and how stress modulates the interactions of this region with the
amygdala. In this Annual Work Seminar, I will be talking about my initial
progress into answering this question. <br> FragileX Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) and Ataxin2 function
together in neuronal translational control and olfactory Long Term
Habituation. </br><br>FragileX Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) and Ataxin2 are candidate RNA
binding proteins with likely roles in microRNA mediated translational
regulation of mRNAs. They are also components of neuronal RiboNuclear
Particles (RNP) that are foci of translational regulation in neurons. This
project is aimed at understanding whether FMRP and Atx2, work together to
enable activity induced translational regulation required for Long Term
Memory (LTM). This is addressed in the context of olfactory Long Term
Habituation(LTH), in a neural circuit encoded by olfactory Local
Interneurons (LNs) and Projection Neurons (PNs). Potentiation of this
inhibitory LN-PN synapse was earlier reported to underlie LTH and require
Atx2 (Das et al., 2011; McCann et al., 2011).
Studies presented here shows that FMRP also is required in PNs for LTH and
associated functional plasticity. Interactions among FMRP and Atx2 along
with other proteins like Me31B and Ago1 indicates, these functions
together in a microRNA dependent process required for LTH. Consistently,
knockdown of these proteins in LNs or PNs, results in increased expression
of a translational reporter, indicating they act together on common
transcripts required for LTH. However, while Atx2 was found to be critical
for RNP aggregation, FMRP seems to be dispensable for the process implying
that distinct mechanisms are used by the two proteins in common pathways
to establish adequate regulation. <br> pBase and Rag1: Structure and Mechanism </br><br>The piggyBac transposon isolated from cabbage looper moth
Trichoplusia ni shows active transposition in mammalian cells. The cognate
transposase enzyme pBase is the primary mediator of the mobility of
iggybac within the genome. Using a combination of structural and
biochemical tools, I aim to elucidate the mechanism of action of the pBase
enzyme.
In the vertebrate immune system, somatic recombination of V, D and J
segments leads to the formation of immunoglobulin and T cell receptor
genes that give rise to receptors with distinct specificities. The Rag1
enzyme plays an important role in initiation of the recombination
reaction. Rag1 binds to recombination signal sequences (RSSs) at the ends
of the gene segments. The RSS is made up of conserved heptamer and nonamer
sequences. Rag1 is predicted to have three distinct domains, and the
central domain is responsible for specific recognition of the RSS
heptamer. I aim to study the interaction between central domain of RagI
and the RSS heptamer. The progress made in these two studies will be
presented <br> Active mechanics and fluctuations of the cell nucleus. </br><br>Active stress fluctuations caused by both the extranuclear
actin cytoskeleton and nuclear chro- matin remodeling proteins result in
systematic fl fluctuations of the nuclear area/volume and shape. Within
the nucleus, at smaller scales, these active stress fluctuations give rise
to spatial hetero- geneity of chromatin. We study the fluctuation in
nuclear area in embryonic stem (ES) cells and differentiated fi broblast
cells (PMEF) both experimentally on live cells and theoretically using an
active elastomer model of the nucleus, where the active stress fluctuation
are parametrized by an active temperature T_a . By comparing the results
of the theoretical model with measurements of the autocorrelation of the
nuclear area, we show that the ES cells are associated with a higher value
of TA compared to the PMEF. We study the spatial correlations of the bound
histones using a polymeric model of chromatin subject to stress
fluctuation. We show that the higher temperature ES cells have a spatial
correlation which decays exponentially, while the PMEF's have a spatial
correlation which shows oscillations, consistent with experiments on the
spatial variation of the fluorescence anisotropy of histones in live
cells. <br> Assessing the drivers of change in carbon storage by tropical
forest fragments </br><br>Tropical forests store over 250 GT of carbon in their
vegetation and therefore play an important role in regulating global
climate. While it is recognized that forest fragmentation has the
potential to alter carbon dynamics in these forests, the magnitudes of and
ecological processes driving these impacts are less-understood. I will
present data and results of our project investigating the ecological
processes that affect the structure and species composition of tree
communities, and resulting impacts on carbon storage, from our work in a
fragmented network of tropical forests in Kodagu in the central Western
Ghats of India. Our work is built on a framework of species traits, in
which we focus on structural and biophysical properties of species, rather
than their identity alone, to gain insights into likely ecological
processes structuring tree communities. Tree communities in fragments
comprised, on average, softer-wooded and smaller-seeded species. While
softer-wooded tree communities store less carbon per unit tree volume,
significant additional losses in carbon are likely to result from a
reduction in forest stature, resulting from a positive association across
species between seed size and maximum adult tree size. I will discuss
these results within the broader context of anthropogenic impacts on
tropical tree communities and ecosystem processes. <br> Circuit mechanisms for linear coding and decorrelation predicted
by a detailed compartmental model of the rat olfactory bulb </br><br>The olfactory bulb (OB) is a pre-processing center between the
olfactory epithelium and higher brain regions in vertebrates. The mitral
cells, which are the principal neurons of the OB, get primary excitation
from olfactory receptor neurons in neuropils called glomeruli. They also
receive inhibition via inter-neurons called peri-glomerular (PG) and
granule cells. Mitral cell activity represents the output from the OB,
mainly to the olfactory cortex and other brain regions.
To explore mechanisms of mitral cell odour coding, we built a biophysical
model of part of the rat OB, using compartmental models for mitral,
granule and PG cells. Synaptic connectivity and strengths were constrained
from in-vitro and in-vivo experiments.
Similar to observations by Priyanka [in preparation] and Adil [Khan et
al., 2008] in our lab, we found in our model too, that the firing time
courses of mitral cells in response to odors were observed to be linear
over limited concentration. However, over a larger concentration range, in
keeping with preliminary experiments, we found that responses could change
in their time profile and were also no longer linear in strength. We found
that inhibition from PG cells could partly offset mitral cell saturation,
but lateral inhibition between mitral cells mediated via granule cells
mildly degraded linearity.
Further, Ashesh [Dhawale et al., 2010] from our lab had shown that odour
responses of sister mitral cells, which receive same primary input, were
decorrelated in their respiratory phase of firing, and independently, in
their change in firing rate compared to air. We found that strong and
differential inhibitory connections to sister mitral cells, from mitral
cells of other glomeruli, were required to cause this decorrelation. <br> Spatial dynamics of genetic exchange in a multipartite plant virus </br><br>Multipartite plant viruses have multiple genome components which are
individually encapsidated within separate coat proteins. This strategy may
lead to high rates of reassortment, whereby discrete genome components get
exchanged among different strains. Reassortment can have important
epidemiological implications, and may lead to the emergence of highly
virulent strains or facilitate adaptation to novel hosts. As multiple
genetically distinct strains must co-infect the same host plant for
reassortment to occur, rates of reassortment are likely to differ among
locations as a result of spatial variation in disease incidence and local
differences in genetic variation. Identifying potential geographic ?hot
spots? of reassortment where novel viral lineages are likely to arise may
be important for informing surveillance efforts. However, spatial
variation in the extent to which reassortment shapes the evolutionary
dynamics of plant viral populations has not been assessed. I will discuss
my analyses of spatial variation in reassortment in Cardamom Bushy Dwarf
Virus (CBDV), a multipartite nanovirus which infects large cardamom,
Amomum subulatum, in sub-Himalayan regions of Northeast India, Nepal and
Bhutan. <br> Cache Optimization in the Hines Neuronal Solver </br><br>Detailed simulations of neuronal networks involve first building
equivalent electrical circuits of the neurons, and then computing the
current flows within and between neurons. The Hines method is a fast
algorithm for performing computations for a single neuron. I have already
implemented the Hines method in the open source simulator, MOOSE. We are
now trying to optimize the calculations for large networks of neurons. In
modern digital computers, speed gains are achieved by writing programs
that use the cache memory effectively. While the main memory provides a
large storage area for simulation data, access to main memory is very
slow. For this reason, a small, but very fast, storage called cache memory
is built into processors. I will present recent work to cache-optimize the
Hines solver for large neuronal networks, and benchmark results from the
same. <br> Role of local landmark cues in odor tracking behavior of fruit
 flies, D. melanogaster </br><br>Flying insects in general, are heavily dependent on visual cues to
maintain stable flight paths. Odor tracking behavior in particular,
requires that the animal maintain precise heading in the direction of the
odor cues to successfully locate the source. We are looking at how insects
might be using visual landmarks placed nearby an odor source. Fruit flies
are known to use panoramic wide-field visual cues to localize around the
odor source but we don't know yet, how small landmarks around the source
can be utilized during odor searching. Using high speed filming to study
free-flight behavior of flies in the presence of odor and landmarks, we
have found that presence of landmark cues can cause significant changes in
the flight trajectories and these changes depend on how the landmarks are
arranged around the odor source. Currently, we are analyzing the portions
of flight trajectories where changes are most prominent and relate it to
the specific components of odor and visual tracking that gives the overall
trajectory. <br> Direct and indirect effects of nutrient deposition on woody
 vegetation of tropical dry forests </br><br>Tropical dry forests constitute India?s most wide spread and extensive
forest type. With its important role in maintaining biodiversity and
provisioning of services for humans, understanding the trajectory of this
mixed tree-grass ecosystem in the face of global change drivers is
critical. Atmospheric deposition of nutrients such as nitrogen (N) and
phosphorus (P) have been identified as important global change agents.
Being major plant nutrients, increases in N and P availability through
deposition have been demonstrated to cause significant shifts in
vegetation structure, diversity and community composition across a number
of ecosystems globally. In tropical dry forests increasing N and P
availability could impact vegetation directly through changes in tree
recruitment, growth, biomass allocation and susceptibility to disturbance
agents such as fire, as well as, indirectly via changes in the properties
of the disturbance regime itself. Further, the tree layer of this
ecosystem can be divided into two functional groups - N fixers and non-N
fixers. With fundamentally different nutrient requirements and acquisition
strategies, differential responses to increased N and P availability may
be expected for the two functional groups. Here I will outline the
framework within which my project aims to quantify the responses of
tropical dry forest woody vegetation to nutrient deposition. I will
summarise results from a germination experiment previously completed and
describe the progress of field based fertilisation and burning experiments
which have been set up over the last year. <br> Anatomical substrates for sensory motor integration in Drosophila </br><br>Invertebrates like Drosophila with relatively few neurons and simplicity
of behaviour allows us to understand the complex neuronal processing. In
this study we focus on identifying neural elements involved in generating
Drosophila locomotion. This stereotyped behaviour is performed by
relatively few neurons residing in a nerve ganglion. Ganglion receives
environmental and internal sensory information at distinct localized
regions. Interneurons process these multimodal inputs to modify the
functional output, the movement. But the connectivity between these
regions and the movement output module/motor neuron domain is not known.
Using Drosophila vesicular glutamate transporter enhancer, we genetically
labelled small sets of either motor or interneurons. The relative
distribution of sensory, inter and motor neuron domains were analyzed.
This analysis show, identified motor neuronal dendrites occupy dorsal and
ventral region of the ganglion while interneurons make distinct
connections with sensory and motor domains. Further studies on single
interneuron behaviour and optogenetics may help understand function and
processing to modulate movement. <br> Behavioral study of air borne odor based tracking in rats </br><br>Animals use air borne odor cues to locate sources of food, mate, predators
etc. They need to identify and track the odor to its source under
different conditions. We study this odor tracking behavior in our lab
using rats. In a restricted go-no-go task, rats have been shown to use
bilateral nasal input to identify and localize odor source. In our study,
we also intend to find out to what extent animals depend on bilateral
nasal input for not only identifying odor, but also navigating towards its
source.
We use a funnel shaped plexiglass box with carbon filter at broader end,
and exhaust fans at the narrower end that allows us to attain laminar air
flow conditions. This helps in introducing streamlined odor whose path can
be outlined using a photo ionization detector. We use high speed camera to
record rat behavior videos @ 60 Hz and a wireless transmitter headstage
with RGB LEDs, that allows us to measure the rat's sniffing frequency and
triangulate it's position during the behavior task. The videos are
analyzed using MATLAB.
We observe that rats learn the task of navigating towards the odor source
using a serial strategy, and gradually learn to directly trail the odor
path. Once learned, they can quickly switch to performing the same task
with another untrained odor. The distribution of direct vs. Serial
strategies also depend on introduction of different types background odors
and also with unilateral nasal blockage. Thus rats change their tracking
behaviors depending upon the conditions they face. I will discuss these
results during my talk. <br> Investigating the dynamics of CLIC/GEEC formation and the
 molecular players involved using single molecule visualization
 techniques </br><br>The CLIC/GEEC (CG) endocytic pathway is responsible for the
internalization of GPI-APs (glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored
proteins) and bulk fluid phase in a wide variety of cell types. This is a
RhoGTPase family, CDC42 regulated, clathrin and dynamin-independent
endocytic pathway. A few molecular players involved in the functioning of
this pathway have been identified; however, the precise roles of these
players in the generation of initial endocytic carriers and their
consumption into GEECs have not been fully investigated. Without the
identification of a clear coat in the nascent budded vesicles (CLICs), it
has been speculated that the recruitment of CDC42 dependent actin
polymerization machinery is important in the mechanics of formation of the
vesicle. To address the roles of potential membrane and cytosolic proteins
in CLIC/GEEC formation, we have developed a live cell assay that captures
the pinching of CLICs from the cell surface in real time. This allows us
to map the dynamics of CLIC/GEEC endocytic components at high temporal and
spatial resolution.
The assay employed involves using a pH sensitive GFP?GPI (super ecliptic
pHluorin-GPI; SEC-GPI) which can differentiate surface SEC-GPI from that
present in newly formed vesicles, by alternating the pH of the external
medium. The challenge is in identifying a CLIC/GEEC endosome formation
site at the cell surface without a known coat protein that concentrates at
the pit. Currently, we find that in most endocytic events, actin and
CDC42 concentration increases and peaks when the endosome is pinched and
then this disappears. Another receptor, CD44(with superecliptic phluorin) 
which uses CLIC/GEEC pathway for endocytosis was also tested in this assay
with actin and showed similar results. However, GRAF1 (BAR protein) that
has been shown to localize on CLIC/GEECs, is present on endosomes at
various stages of pre- and post-pinching. As a control, we observe that
these endocytic structures show minimal colocalization with clathrin and
dynamin. The dynamics of other molecular players using this assay is
currently being investigated. <br> A genetic RNAi Screen for G-Protein Coupled Receptors Involved in
 Regulation of Flight in Drosophila melanogaster </br><br>Calcium (Ca2+) is a versatile signaling molecule that regulates various
cellular processes which in turn modulate many organismal behavior. In
order to achieve this versatility, Ca2+ levels inside the cell are
perceived as signals in many different ways (1). To generate Ca2+ signals,
some extracellular signaling molecules like hormones and neurotransmitters
bind and activate G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) which in turn
activate phospholipase C&#946; (PLC&#946;). PLC&#946; cleaves
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate inositol
1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 binds to the IP3 Receptor, a ligand gated
Ca2+ channel on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, creating a surge of
Ca2+ release from the ER (2). IP3 receptor is one of the most important
components of the Ca2+ signaling toolkit.
My goal is to find other important molecules of this Ca2+ signaling
pathway which are required for the initiation of this cascade i.e.
G-protein coupled receptors. It has been shown that reduced levels of IP3R
on pan neuronal (C155GAL4) expression of an itpr transgene dsRNA result in
flight defects (3). Recently it has been shown that silencing the IP3R
using RNAi, in the dopaminergic neurons (TH GAL4), resulted defects in
flight maintenance (S. Sadaf, unpublished data). This suggests that
different sets of neurons are involved in regulation of initiation and
maintenance of flight. It is therefore speculated that different GPCRs may
render such varied phenotypes depending on the neuronal subtype background
under which they act.
I have done a genetic screen for GPCRs that could be important for
regulation of flight in drosophila. 22 GPCRs out of 111 receptors were
found to be involved in regulation of flight. These receptors were
validated for their interaction with IP3 receptor mediated Ca2+ signaling.
Five GPCRs out of 22 were found to regulate flight through IP3 receptor
mediated Ca2+ signaling. These receptors were checked for their
developmental and functional roles during adult. It was found that out of
the six GPCRs identified, two are required during the development of the
flight circuit, and another two are important during neuronal development
as well as adult function of flight circuit. However, one is required
specifically during adults. Further, we have investigated the neuronal
domains of one receptor namely pigment dispersing factor receptor (PdfR)
that regulate flight through intracellular calcium signaling.
This analysis has allowed us to identify neurons that regulate flight
through GPCRs driven IP3 mediated Ca2+ signaling in Drosophila
melanogaster.

 Modifies the Mechanical Microenvironment </br><br>The mechanical environment has significant effects on cell survival,
apoptosis and differentiation. However, the precise mechanisms by which
this is mediated is not fully understood and a concerted effort from the
community is in place. Most studies in culture deal with two extremes of
cell density: either cells are sparsely distributed so as to analyze
single cell or cells are densely plated as a monolayer, where collective
activities of a group of cells can be studied. However, cells in a tissue
are often present neither as isolated individual cells nor as monolayer
but as groups of cells connected through the extracellular matrix. It
therefore becomes important to understand how the mechano-response of a
cell changes when it is connected to other cells via a soft deformable
matrix but not physically in direct contact with each other.
In this work, we explored the behavior of human mesenchymal stem cells
plated on a soft substrate at sub-confluent seeding densities. We find
that depending on distance from neighboring cells and other mechanical and
geometric parameters of the substrate, the mechano-response may vary
widely. While a single isolated cell takes a rounded morphology on a very
soft substrate as is well known, beyond some threshold spacing, cells can
spread and acquire a morphology as they do on a stiff substrate like
glass. We hypothesize that in such closely spaced arrangements, cells
sense the presence of a neighboring cell by sensing the tension developed
in the substrate caused by contractility and in response both cells start
spreading. We find that cell-matrix mechanics play a major role in such
cell density dependent spreading. We also show that such cell-cell
mechanical interaction can modify other cell behavior such as cell cycle
progression and cell division. While isolated cells on very soft substrate
cannot divide because of lack of contractility, which is essential for
proliferation, cells at high density can jointly create sufficient
contractility to go through the cell cycle and overcome the effect of
substrate softness. In summary, cells can collectively modify their
mechanical micro-environment and thus can change their fate in a feed-back
mechanism. Future studies will explore the molecular mechanisms
underpinning these observations. <br> Not Given </br><br>Not Given <br> Designing cooperativity into the designed protein Top7 </br><br>Top7 is a designed globular protein with a novel fold. It shows signatures
of non-cooperative folding (non-two state) in both experimental studies
and computer simulations. Molecular dynamics of simplified native centric
models of Top7 show a significantly populated intermediate. As most other
similarly sized, natural globular proteins fold cooperatively, the
non-natural topology of Top7 has been suggested as a reason for its
non-cooperative folding. Here we computationally examine the folding of
Top7 in order to understand the structural factors that lead to the
intermediate formation. We find that its folding cooperativity can be
increased by optimally packing the N-terminal half of protein and by
destabilizing the C-terminal intermediate structure. We implemented these
two strategies in our model by modifying the input contact map. This
resulted in cooperative folding without altering the topology of the
protein. We also propose amino acid mutations that mimic this effect. We
conclude that, it should be possible to make a sequence fold cooperatively
to the structure of Top7 but to do so side-chain packing need to be
carefully designed. Experimental folding studies of Top7 show the presence
of non-native states and native centric coarse grained simulation studies
whose potential accounts for desolvation barriers and non-native
interactions have been able to mimic experimental results. We will be
exploring such potentials to study our proposed mutants for their ability
to fold cooperatively. <br> Neurophysiological changes triggered by Acute Immobilization
 Stress in the amygdala </br><br>Stress modulates neuronal structure and function in the amygdala. A single
episode of stress (2h acute stress) leads to a delayed onset of both
anxiety like behaviour and an increase in spine density in the
amygdala. We investigated the electrophysiological correlates of these
changes using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from projection neurons in
the Lateral Amygdala(LA). We find that acute stress leads to an increase
in basal excitatory transmission in the LA. This is partly contributed by
an increase in the presynaptic probability of glutamate release at
thalamic inputs. Preliminary results suggest that this increase correlates
with a reduction in Long-Term Potentiation(LTP), which is considered to be
a substrate for learning. We therefore looked at amygdalar - LTP dependent
auditory fear learning and found no effect of acute stress on it. 
Endocannabinoids are retrograde signalling molecules whose primary
function is to gate neurotransmitter release. Since we observed change in
probability of neurotransmitter release due to acute stress, we
hypothesized that endocannabinoids might be a key player in regulating
this. Consistent with the hypothesis, we find that pharmacologically
increasing the levels of endocannabinoids can reverse some of the delayed
changes due to acute stress. In a parallel study, we also find that NMDA
receptor mediated activity in the amygdala during stress is critical for
inducing such changes. <br> Biocatalytic Role of Eukaryotic Rieske Oxygenases, DAF-36 and Nvd </br><br>Rieske non-heme iron oxygenases (RO) constitute a well-studied class of
enzymes in prokaryotes. The oxygenase component, together with a reductase
and sometimes a ferredoxin, form a multicomponent RO system. In
prokaryotes, ROs activate relatively inert carbon-carbon bonds to initiate
the aerobic catabolism of aromatic compounds. They carry out a variety of
reactions, such as dihydroxylation, monohydroxylation, desaturation,
sulfoxidation, and dealkylation in stereo and regio- specific manner. The
versatility of these enzymes makes them useful for large-scale
biosynthesis of chiral compounds. Although the structure and function of
different prokaryotic ROs have been extensively characterized, similar
studies of eukaryotic ROs have not been reported. The structural
information of these enzymes can help us to manipulate and modify these
enzymes to improve the efficiency as a biocatalyst. Several conserved
genes that encode predicted ROs in eukaryotic systems have been
identified. Here, we focus on two of these: DAF-36 from C. elegans
(nematode worm), and Neverland (Nvd) from D. melanogaster (fruit-fly).
DAF-36 and Nvd play a major role in the early stages of steroid hormone
biosynthesis, primarily in the conversion of cholesterol of
dehydrocholesterol. It is noteworthy that the proposed RO-catalyzed
reaction is oxygen-dependent desaturation and monohydroxylation, neither
of which is well characterized even in prokaryotes. In our study, we will
first determine the structure of these proteins using X-ray
crystallography. Following this, we will measure the specific activity and
thermodynamic parameters of the ROs (both wild-type and mutated) using
steady-state kinetic and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)
experiments. These experiments will provide information on how and why the
active site of the enzymes and the orientation of substrate control the
regio- and stereo- selectivity of the products. These studies will help us
engineer these enzymes and design biocatalysts to catalyze a variety of
chiral organic transformations that can be of relevance to pharmaceutical
companies. <br> A CD66+ progenitor like cell may serve as an intersection point
 between the viral life cycle and cellular transformation in a
 cervical precancerous cell line </br><br>Cervical cancer is caused by persistent infection with the High Risk Human
Papillomaviruses. The virus infects the basal layer and maintains itself
as an episome in these cells. However, the completion of the viral life
cycle, including the transcription of late genes, amplification of the
viral genome, viral assembly and egress take place only after the host
keratinocyte has undergone differentiation. Also, it has been observed
that only a few cells amplify the genome, suggesting a non-uniform
cellular response to the virus. Transformation is thought to be the
side-effect of the ability of the viral oncogenes E6 and E7 to confer
replicative potential in differentiated cells. Other viral gene products
such as E1^E4 have been implicated in viral genome amplification. However,
their role in potentiating transformation remains less clear.
We have previously described a subset of Notch High CD66+ cells in primary
tumours and cervical cancer cell lines that have enhanced tumor
propagating and metastatic properties. It was unclear if such cells
existed and contributed to the early stages of cervical cancer. We
examined this in the precancerous CIN612 cell line which is derived from a
natural infection of HPV31b. We find that some cells in the basal layer
of CIN612 rafts express CD66. Sorted CD66 cells from undifferentiated
cultures have elevated levels of Notch1. We also find higher expression
of the keratinocyte progenitor markers p63 and DNMT1 in this subset. This
is consistent with the idea that CD66+ cells are a progenitor pool.
Further, by transfecting keratinocytes with HPV31 genomes we find an
increase in the intracellular levels of Notch and DNMT1, suggesting that
these molecules can be upregulated by viral gene products. Paradoxically,
we find that CD66+ cells, even in the undifferentiated state, have higher
E1^E4 and viral genome content in combination with other molecular
features associated with HPV genome amplification.
Our data suggests that CD66+ cells in CIN612 have dual features of
progenitors and differentiated cells, which may allow for the persistence
of this population while maintaining the viral genome. <br> Quiescence-specific miRNAs and their targets </br><br>Satellite cells are mitotically quiescent and undifferentiated myogenic
stem cells that are involved in the normal growth of muscle, as well as
regeneration following injury or disease. Satellite cells are found
sandwiched between the basement membrane and sarcolemma (cell membrane) of
individual muscle fibres. During muscle damage satellite cells exit cell
cycle, proliferate, differentiate and fuse to form mature myofiber. A
small proportion of proliferating myoblasts returns to the niche by
repressing myogenic fate and enter into a reversibly arrested state,
restoring the progenitor population.
Previous studies from our lab and from others, have shown that quiescence
is a poised state, where cell is primed for activation when damage
signals are released. In addition to transcriptional, epigenetic and
signaling regulation, control of translation and mRNA degradation are an
important part of gene regulation. Untranslated mRNAs are either degraded
or held in a translationally silent state, in special sites within cells,
the mRNP granules or P-bodies. We found a large number of RNA binding
proteins specifically induced in quiescent myoblasts, as well as several
quiescence-induced miRNAs.
I will present a detailed bioinformatic analysis of miRNA targets, that
are part of important signaling pathways which regulate cell cycle and
myogenic differentiation. Components of ErbB, MAPKK, Apoptosis and MTOR
signaling pathways were found to be highly enriched for miRNA targets, as
were a number of RNA localization proteins. My observations suggest that
miRNAs are involved in fine-tuning of various cell cycle and
differentiation genes in quiescence and might prevent the localization of
transcripts, in order to keep the cell in a poised state, ready for
activation. Ongoing experiments address functional tests of these
hypotheses using perturbation analysis. <br> Numbers and distribution of axonal mitochondria correlates with
 neuronal behaviour </br><br>Mitochondria are responsible for doing many vital functions like ATP
production, calcium buffering, regulation of apoptosis, reactive oxygen
species generation etc. In neuronal cells presence of mitochondria at
synapses and nodes of Ranvier is important due to high local energy needs.
Mitochondria undergo both fast and slow axonal transport. Fast axonal
transport of mitochondria on the microtubule track takes place with the
aid of molecular motors. Studies using neuronal cultures have reported
that the potential of mitochondria in axons co-relates with the direction
of transport. Further, these underlying processes result in uniform
mitochondrial distributions in axons of neurons.
We have studied how mitochondria are distributed in C.elegans touch
neurons and attempted to identify the factors which govern their
distribution. Touch neurons are a set of six specialised neurons which
mediate response to gentle touch and have larger diameter microtubules (15
protofilament). Mitochondrial distribution in these neurons has been
studied using the transgenic strain jsIs609 that mark nearly all
mitochondria in these cells. Our results show that mitochondrial number
and distribution is non random in adults with very few mitochondria
present within 3um of each other. This distribution develops as the
animal grows and is established in the thrid larval stage. Integrity of
motors and microtubule tracks (15 protofilament) is essential to maintain
wild type numbers and distribution of mitochondria. We have also tested
whether this distribution contributes to neuronal behaviour. We observe
that wild type numbers and distribution of mitochondria are essential for
elucidating wild type touch responses. <br> Visual and mechanosensory input to antennal positioning in honey
 bees </br><br>Antennae are multimodal sensory organs. They are used to sense a variety
of stimuli including olfactory, mechanosensory and tactile stimuli. For
all of these functions, knowledge of antennal position is critical. Many
insects maintain their antennae at a constant position during flight which
is thought to play an important role in flight control. Perturbation of
antennal position in moths leads to a change in their flight trajectory
and pitch angles. Honey bees have also been shown to use optic flow cues
to gauge how far they have flown and their flight speed. We aim to study
the role of mechanosensory and visual stimuli in modulation of antennal
position. We find that tethered and freely flying honeybees respond to
increasing speeds of airflow by decreasing their interantennal angles.
However, with increasing optic flow rates, their interantennal angles
increase. We therefore hypothesise that opposing visual and mechanosensory
inputs may act in a combinatorial manner to influence antennal
positioning. <br> Study to understand the biomechanics of the ability to throw
 accurately at high speeds. </br><br>Humans have a remarkable capability to throw a projectile at very high
speeds accurately. Accuracy in throwing is achieved by releasing the
projectile at the correct position in hand trajectory. The launch window
for finger opening is very small and is inversely dependent on the size of
the target and distance from it. There are various theories that try to
explain the correct timing of finger opening including those that
emphasize the role of central commands or the importance of feedback from
various joints. Others believe that as the hand decelerates, the fingers
open because of inertial forces from the ball.
We hypothesize that the role of mechanical coupling between the fingers
and the wrist is primarily responsible for the phenomenon. This coupling
is called 'tenodesis'. It is exhibited as the movement of fingers towards
flexion as wrists move into extension and vice versa due to the tension in
the long tendons of hand muscles. We plan to undertake a series of human
experiments to test the contribution of tenodesis to throwing accuracy by
measuring kinematics, force production and muscle activity in forearm
muscles. <br> Role of astrocytes in stress induced plasticity. </br><br>Astrocytes are amongst the most abundant glial cells present in the
central nervous system (CNS). For a long time, they have been considered
to be passive support cells involved in synaptic and extra synaptic
homeostasis. However, recently, numerous studies have shown that
astrocytes also play a crucial role in both developmental and adult neural
plasticity. Studies on stress-induced plasticity in the mammalian brain
have mostly focused on neurons while the effects of stress on glia are not
fully understood. My project involves looking at how stress affects
astrocytes and its crosstalk with the neurons it supports.
Chronic immobilization stress (CIS) is known to have contrasting effects
on the neurons of the hippocampus and the amygdala in terms of structural,
synaptic and intrinsic plasticity. We hypothesized if the divergent
effects of stress also apply to astrocytes. Preliminary data show an
increase in their number in the basal amygdala along with an increase in
the mean soma surface area. On the other hand, the number of astrocytes in
the hippocampus decreased together with a reduction in surface area of
their soma. As astrocytes are the primary glutamate uptake and recycling
cells in the CNS, I shall now investigate how CIS alters the expression of
astrocytic glutamate transporters and their regulation. Further, based on
the knowledge that stress perturbs the expression of neurotrophins like
Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which promotes neuronal growth
and that astrocytes secrete BDNF and a plethora of other neurotrophins, a
major aim of my project is to probe if these glia derived neurotrophins
play a role in mediating stress induced neuronal plasticity. <br> Exploring the interactions of dopamine with the human serotonin
 receptorfamily. </br><br>We are interested in the interactions of dopamine (DA) with serotonin
(5-HT) receptors. 5-HT and DA are two important neurotransmitters present
in a wide range of living organisms. With the exception of the 5-HT3
receptor which is a ligand-gated ion channel, the effects of both 5-HT and
DA are mediated via G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Together the serotonergic and dopaminergic systems have been implicated in
regulation of a number of normal and abnormal behaviors and functions.
Most such interactions are not well understood. The two neurotransmitter
systems have been shown to modulate each other?s functions via their own
receptors. However, work done in our laboratory and others has shown that
serotonin and dopamine can also interact directly with each other?s
receptors.
DA has been shown to act as a partial agonist and activate rat 5-HT2A and
5-HT2C receptors and human 5-HT1A, 5-HT2C and 5-HT3receptorsexpressedin
Xenopus oocytes as well as rat 5-HT2A and human 5-HT2A receptors expressed
in HEK293 cells. DA has also been shown to bind human 5-HT1A receptors. 
On the basis of these results and further observations we hypothesize that
DA interacts with a very large group of 5-HT receptor subtypes. Our
specific questions are: What is the nature and extent of interaction of DA
with 5-HT receptors? What are the downstream effects and how different are
they from serotonin-mediated effects?
In this AWS, I will be talking about the generation of fluorescently
tagged 5-HT receptors and generation and characterization of inducible
cell lines stably expressing the receptors. <br> Understanding the cold and heat denaturation of hyperthermophilic
 protein: A case study on Ctd-MK0293 </br><br>Small, single domain hyperthermophilic proteins have become increasingly
important as models for protein folding. However, one of the general
thermodynamic characteristics of protein structures - cold denaturation -
has not been observed for hyperthermophilic proteins. We have investigated
the equilibrium folding thermodynamics of the hyperthermophilic protein
Ctd-MK0293 (C-terminal domain of MK0293). This protein is natively present
in the archaeal methanogen Methanopyrus Kandleri which survives in
temperatures upto 110?C. We investigate if signatures of the protein?s
native environment can be seen in its room-temperature folding
thermodynamics. We find that the protein resists unfolding upto a
concentration of 4.1 M guanidinium hydrochloride (GdnHCl) at 298 K, but
other than this unusual stability, shows normal ?mesophile-like? two state
folding behaviour. We use isothermal GdnHCl-induced denaturation curves at
different temperatures and temperature-induced melting curves at different
GdnHCl concentrations in conjunction with the linear free energy model to
derive various thermodynamic parameters (&#916;G, &#916;H, &#916;S,
&#916;Cp) to high precision. The low temperature denaturation transition
of this protein becomes experimentally accessible upon simultaneously
varying both the temperature and the denaturant concentration, and here we
thermodynamically characterize it. Furthermore, we analyze the heat and
cold denaturation transitions for both Ctd-MK0293 and several other
proteins using calculated solvent accessible surface areas (SASAs). We
also analyze the individual contributions of polar and non-polar SASAs to
these transitions. Our calculations suggest that the extreme thermal
stability of Ctd-MK0293 is achieved by better H-bonding and internal
packing. In addition, in contrast to current belief but in agreement with
early work of Makhatadze and Privalov we find that the hydration of polar
groups plays a major role in the cold denaturation of proteins. <br> Understanding the role of autophagy in Notch mediated survival </br><br>T lymphocytes play a central role in adaptive immunity. The repertoire of
T-effectors generated in response to antigen is destined to die during
termination of the inflammatory phase in a highly coordinated death of
antigen-activated cells. There are selected subsets of T cells that escape
this death (induced by cytokine deprivation) to impart long term memory
and homeostatic regulation of the immune response. T-cells are acutely
dependent on cues received from extracellular cytokines for nutrient
uptake, survival, proliferation and differentiation.
In this context, previous work in lab has shown that activated
T-regulatory cells (Tregs) implicated in immune tolerance are resistant to
apoptosis induced by cytokine deprivation (neglect). Non-nuclear Notch
activated signaling, integrated with mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR)
for Tregs survival (1). mTOR is a modulator of autophagy, which regulates
survival in the context of nutrient deprivation(2). In this study we show
that Notch integrates with cellular autophagy intermediates to mediate
survival in Tregs. Inhibiting the autophagic pathway (by chemical or
genetic intervention) ablated survival in Tregs. Immunofluorescence
combined with imaging studies and western blot analysis for LC3 (Light
Chain 3, marker of autophagy) revealed induction of autophagy in Tregs in
response to neglect. Blocking Notch receptor processing, using a
&#947;-Secretase Inhibitor, abrogated these events (and survival).
Consistent with earlier bservations, autophagic flux remained unperturbed
when the Notch nuclear signaling intermediate RBPj&#954; was ablated.
Furthermore, in this study we find that Notch dependent induction of
autophagy regulated mitochondrial transmembrane potential, redox state and
organelle mass. In contrast to T-effectors which have fragmented
mitochondria, activated Tregs have fused and tubular mitochondrial
organization. This mitochondrial contiguity observed in Tregs was lost
with inhibition of Notch signaling or autophagy. Collectively, our data
suggests that non-nuclear Notch activity positively influences autophagy
to promote cell survival.

2 Nutrient-dependent regulation of autophagy through the target of
rapamycin pathway. Chang, Y. Y. et al Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2009.37, <br> Deciphering the role of Prdm2, a histone methyl transferase, in
 regulating pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells </br><br>Self renewal and pluripotency are the hallmarks of embryonic stem (ES)
cells which permit them to proliferate yet retain the ability to give rise
to cells of all the lineages upon differentiation. Pluripotency is a
complex phenomenon governed by multiple mechanisms comprising an
intricately regulated transcriptional network which impinges on gene
expression. Epigenetic regulation is an important regulatory mechanism
that determines the chromatin state, with downstream effects on gene
expression. Chromatin state is regulated by DNA methylation, histone
modifications and remodelling proteins which collectively control access
of regulatory elements to the transcription machinery. My project aims at
investigating the role of Prdm2, an epigenetic modulator in regulating
pluripotency in mouse ES cells. Prdm2, a histone H3 K9 Di-methyl
transferase, also called Retinoblastoma binding protein
(RIZ-Retinoblastoma Interacting Zinc finger protein), encodes two proteins
-RIZ1, containing the PR domain (similar to SET domain) and RIZ2 which
lacks the PR domain. These two proteins have a yin-yang expression
pattern: RIZ1 expression is lost/altered in many cancers where RIZ2
expression up-regulated. My project draws inspiration from earlier studies
in the lab where this protein has been shown to epigenetically regulate
quiescence in a skeletal muscle stem cell model. Additionally, it has been
shown to be associated with the promoters of pluripotency factors such as
Oct4 and Jmjd1a, besides having overlapping genomic targets with Prdm14, a
Prdm family member recently shown to regulate pluripotency in human ES
cells. Other members of the Prdm family have also been shown to play roles
in either regulating pluripotency or lineage determination during
development. Thus, Prdm2 is a reasonable candidate for regulating
pluripotency or differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells. Besides
addressing the role of Prdm2 in mouse ES cells, my study will also compare
and contrast Prdm2-mediated regulation of pluripotency in mouse adult
muscle stem cells vs embryonic stem cells. <br> Understanding the role of Phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate-
 4-kinase in Drosophila melanogaster Photoreceptors. </br><br>Phototransduction in Drosophila is a model to study G-protein coupled
receptor mediated signalling and cellular membrane turnover. Light evokes
a rapid PI(4,5)P2 turnover as well as membrane turnover of the specialized
apical microvillar membrane called the rhabdomere of the photoreceptor.
The aim of this study is to understand the role of a new class to PI 
kinases called -Phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate-4-kinase (PIP4K) in
membrane homeostasis using Drosophila photoreceptors as a model system.
The enzyme dPIP4K phosphorylates PI5P to generate PI(4,5)P2 in vitro .
Finding from the lab and others emphasises that PIP4K functions in
regulating the levels of the novel Phosphoinositide - PI5P in vivo. The
role of PI5P in vivo still remains unclear. A single PIP4K gene exists in
Drosophila, a knockout for which was generated in the lab and called
dPIP4K29 (Gupta et al. 2013). dPIP4K29 showed normal photoreceptor
development and ultra structure. But, the levels of the apical membrane
proteins - Rhodopsin1 and the Calcium channel TRP were decreased in
dPIP4K29 under light. Also, large numbers of double membrane vesicles
resembling autophagic intermediates were observed in the dPIP4K29
photoreceptor under light rearing. These previous observations in the lab
suggested a role for dPIP4K in cellular membrane turnover, the cellular
and molecular basis of which I have been probing. The over expressed PIP4K
localized as distinct punctae and soluble form in the cell body of the
photoreceptors. Also, immunocytochemistry revealed an altered distribution
of the Rh1 loaded endocytic vesicles (RLVs) in dPIP4K29. Further, total
cellular levels of the RAB5 ? a regulatory GTPase on the early endosome
and the late endosomal/lysosomal protein Lamp1 seemed altered in the
mutant. It remains to be seen if the PIP4K punctae localised to these
endo-lysosomal compartments of the cell. Also, dPIP4K29 photoreceptors
show a decrease in regulatory TOR kinase activity in response to light.
TOR kinases localize to late endo-lysosomal compartments and altered
membrane trafficking is reported to disrupt their function. Further,
experiments are in line to probe how the PIP4K regulates cellular
endomembranes and if this in turn regulates TOR activity in photoreceptor
in response to light. <br> Pollination ecology of *Clerodendrum viscosum </br><br>Clerodendrum viscosum is a native shrub species of Western Ghat. I am
working on different aspects of pollination of this species. How the
interaction between different components of pollination and in turn their
interaction with underlying ecological components determining plant?s
female reproductive success and how top-down effects are modulating the
outcome is my research topic. To explore these things in detail I need to
know the basic pollination biology of that species. I am working on that
too. <br> Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K) regulates PI4P
levels and the light response in Drosophila photoreceptors. </br><br>Phosphoinositides play crucial roles in many cellular processes including
generation of second messengers, cytoskeletal rearrangements, vesicle
transport and control of ion channel activity. Drosophila photoreceptors
represent an important genetic model for G-protein coupled hydrolysis of
phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate [PIP2]. In this cascade, light
induced rhodopsin isomerization results in G protein mediated activation
of a phospholipase C isoform &#946; (norpA) resulting in the hydrolysis of
PIP2 into soluble inositol 1,4,5 triphosphate (IP3) and membrane-bound
diacylglycerol (DAG). The generation of a lipid second messenger
eventually leads to the opening of the Ca2+ and Na+ permeable TRP and TRPL
channels and results in the depolarization of the photoreceptor. In order
to maintain the ability of photoreceptors to respond to light during
continuing illumination, PIP2 needs to be resynthesized. We are interested
to decipher the principal route by which PIP2 might be synthesized in
Drosophila photoreceptors and the PIPkin (phosphatidylinositol phosphate
kinase) involved in the last step of this process.
In silico analysis of Drosophila genome suggested the existence of four
PIPkins: CG9985 (sktl), CG3682 (dPIP5K), CG17471 and CG6355. Based on
available biochemical data and bioinformatics analysis dPIP5K was selected
for study. Loss-of-function mutant of dPIP5K, dPIP5K18 and dPIP5K30 was
generated by homologous recombination. Mass spectrometry based analysis
suggested that PIP levels are elevated in dPIP5K18 and dPIP5K30 retinae,
strongly suggesting that the activity of dPIP5K plays key role in the
conversion of PI4P to PI(4,5)P2.The major phenotype of dPIP5K mutant is
reduced sensitivity to light as evident from electroretinogram (ERG)
recordings. dPIP5K18 and dPIP5K30 had minimal defects in the photoreceptor
ultrastructure and levels of all major phototransduction proteins were
unaffected. <br> A nucleic acid-based fluorescent, ratiometric sensor for cAMP. </br><br>A molecular sensor has two properties: (a) It recognizes the molecule of
interest and (b) upon recognition produces a detectable signal
proportional to the amount of the molecule present. Using DNA or RNA to
construct sensors makes it easy to incorporate both these properties.
SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment) is a
well established method for finding DNA sequences (?aptamers?) which
recognize the molecule of interest (1). Furthermore, since DNA/RNA
structure is fairly predictable, it is possible to program a DNA/RNA
assembly using its aptamer that results in a FRET change upon binding its
target (2, 3, 4). cAMP is a very important intracellular secondary
messenger. Currently available single cell cAMP sensors are based on
proteins which are its downstream targets. These sensors can have unwanted
side-effects: their over expression may lead to changes in cell behavior;
secondly they may swamp the endogenous proteins that interact with these
downstream target (5). In this light, a nucleic acid-based sensor may be
better suited for investigating cAMP signaling. We have made a
nucleic-acid- based fluorescent ratiometric sensor for cAMP, based on the
Class II cAMP RNA aptamer (6). In my AWS I will present the design of RNA-
based fluorescent ratiometric sensor that we have developed in the lab. I
will also present its in vitro characterization and initial experiments
demonstrating that the sensor can be used to reliably measure cAMP
secreted by M. Smegmatis into growth media.

microRNAs also. Small RNAs have been reported to be deregulated in many
cancers, and diseases but limited to their phenotype, especially rare
enough to be used as therapeutics. Thus, similar to other cancer genes, it
is possible that miRNAs play distinct roles in which only a subset
function as ?drivers? of cancer progression. The promise of miRNA therapy
is perhaps greatest in cancer due to the apparent role of miRNAs as tumor
suppressors and oncogenes. MicroRNAs target multiple genes/signalling
pathways by mRNA degradation or translation inhibition of target
molecules, re-establishing the expression of a single miRNA to that of the
non-diseased tissue will produce a more pervasive therapeutic effect
compared to drugs that obey the one-drug-one-target paradigm. Current
challenges include delivery of synthetic oligonucleotides, stability, and
safety. Recently, miR-34 based therapy for tumors would be first miRNA
mimics to reach the clinic.
Drug resistance phenomenon in chronic myeloid leukemia is regulated by
poorly understood cell intrinsic and extrinsic signals. K562 cells,
erythro-leukemic blast crisis CML cell line with wild type Bcr-Abl
tyrosine kinase, serve a good model to evaluate our objective to study
Imatinib resistance phenomenon regulated by specific miRs. Here, we report
that miR-182 is over-expressed in CML cells, and K562 cells, and targets
notch signalling pathway by down-regulating Hes1. Though miR-182 is
over-expressed in Imatinib treated CML cells, miR-182 has an important
role in CML by restricting notch signalling pathway, needs to be studied
using enforced over-expression, and knockout strategies. Thus, a better
understanding of genetics, and miR-182 function could be translated into
applications such as miR replacement therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia. <br> Target identification of anti-bacterial compounds with an unknown
 mechanism of action </br><br>Identifying valid drug targets and their potential inhibitors are the just
the first steps in the course of developing antibacterials. A valid target
is generally defined as one that is essential for the growth or survival
of the pathogen and can be specifically inhibited without affecting the
human host. Drug companies identify such enzymes and assay millions of
compounds against them in High Throughput Screens to identify inhibitors. 
Inhibitors identified from these screens very often fail to show any
antibacterial activity. And when they do, it may happen that these
compounds kill the bacteria but by a mechanism that is not intended. 
Pharmaceutical companies have libraries of such molecule obtained from
enzyme screens as well as whole cell assays whose mechanism of action
(MOA) is not known. How does one decipher the mechanism so that these
molecules can be exploited? There is increasing evidence that, independent
of the target inhibited, bacterial cell death ultimately occurs through a
generalized mechanism involving modulation of multiple pathways that leads
to generation of free radicals caused by a skewed [NAD]/[NADH] ratio. The
central carbon metabolism plays an important role in maintaining this
ratio correctly. To decipher the MOA, I discuss a novel methodology that
involves comparing experimentally determined minimum inhibitory
concentrations of Escherichia coli knockout strains (knockouts that
impinge on the central carbon metabolism) with predictions of an in-
silico dynamic model built by Cellworks. <br> Activity driven spatiotemporal patterning of cell surface molecules </br><br>The spatial distribution and the remodeling dynamics of the nanoclusters
of outer leaflet glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored proteins (GPI-APs)
and other lipid tethered molecules like Ras, is regulated by the activity
of the underlying cortical acto-myosin(Goswami et al., 2008).We have
developed a theoretical framework to explain the mechanism of this
nanoclustering, based on active hydrodynamics of the CA and its coupling
to the membrane(Gowrishankar et al., 2012). This framework provides
insights into the behavior of molecules that interact with the dynamic
filaments of CA; reflected in their cell surface organization, dynamics
and distribution.
In my past seminars, I have shown experimental validations of a key
prediction of the theoretical framework, i.e., dynamic filaments can act
as membrane organizing machinery using a chimeric cell-surface probe
interacting directly with actin. In fact, we find, the actin-binding
transmembrane protein molecules are organized both at nano-(<20nm) and
mesoscale by this machinery akin to the GPI-APs (Goswami et al., 2008),
which might be coupling via indirect lipid-based trans-bilayer coupling.
We expect these two probes to have varying affinity (or strength of
coupling) towards the dynamic filaments owing to the fundamental
differences in their coupling, with consequences on their cluster
remodeling dynamics and spatial segregation. In this seminar, I will
discuss the subtle differences in the dynamics of nano-clustering between
the two probes, using a novel multi-point photolysis tool. Moreover, using
Homo-FRET imaging, I will show how the clusters of these two molecules are
spatially segregated at both nanoscale and mesoscale. Using, a polarity
sensitive membrane probe (Laurdan), I am studying the local lipid
environment of the clustered regions of the two probes. We predict, the
lipid-ordered (*lo*) like regions to enrich GPI-AP clusters, and argue how
an active mechanism can drive the formation of domains what most likely
resemble ?lipid-rafts? in a living cellular context. These studies will
eventually contribute significantly in building up a new paradigm for
understanding molecular organization and its spatiotemporal regulation on
the plasma membrane.

cervical cancer. Aberrant notch signaling has been shown to play an
important role in cervical and other cancers. Notch signaling is highly
context dependent, and is capable of acting in a tumour suppressing as
well as tumour propagating manner. Previous studies have shown that the
HPV16 viral oncogenes E6 and E7 are capable of cooperating with activated
notch signaling to induce malignant transformation in keratinocytes. I
seek to understand the relation between the HR HPVs and notch signaling. I
would like to assess whether the high risk human papillomaviruses are
capable of modulating the notch1 pathway, and if they are, the mechanisms
behind this. I have thus far done some preliminary analysis of notch
related biochemical changes induced in HPV16 transfected keratinocytes.
My second project is centred around histone methylation in cancer. Along
with genetic mutations, epigenetic changes have been recognised to be an
important facet of aberrant gene expression in cancer. The
methyltransferases Suv39H1 and Suv39H2 are histone 3 lysine 9 di and tri
(H3K9me2/me3) methyltransferases. They have been shown to have roles in
cell differentiation, cell cycle progression, senescence and telomere
length maintenance in various systems, and changed expression patterns of
these have been documented in human cancers. Data from our lab shows
lowered expression of these methyltransferases in anchorage deprived
spheroid cultures grown from metastasis derived CaSki cells, as well as
CD66+ve cells, both of which are enriched for stem-like cells. I plan to
assess if changes in the activities of these players are functionally
relevant in cervical cancer. I will be outlining my work plan for this
project. <br> Sequence and structure analysis of RNA-binding proteins </br><br>RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are involved in the regulation of various
aspects of co- and post-transcriptional gene expression, including RNA
splicing, polyadenylation, capping, modification, export, localization,
translation and turnover. They are an extremely diverse group of proteins,
reflecting the diverse functional requirements of cellular RNAs. So,
precise molecular recognition between RNA elements and protein residues is
crucial. RNA sequence and structure collectively influence protein
recognition and binding. All known structural entries of RNA-binding
proteins have been subjected to rigorous structural comparisons which have
permitted the realisation into families of RNA-binding proteins such that
mathematical profiles could be created for such families which will serve
as start points for sequence searches. Previous work from our lab on
DNA-binding proteins had employed pure sequence information to build such
profiles[1]. Preliminary work on genome wide survey of RNA binding
proteins in the human genome, using these mathematical profiles, will also
be discussed. Starting from around 120 families, close to 650 gene
products are seen to retain sequence signature of RNA-binding domains
suggesting over-representation of such proteins in the human genome in
terms of paralogs.
In order to understand the functional differences amongst paralogs of
RNA-binding proteins in the human genome, an in-depth study has been
performed on the Transformer2 (Tra2) proteins in humans, which activate
splicing inclusion. A single Tra2 protein is conserved in fruit flies and
has two mammalian homologues called Tra2-&#945; and Tra2-&#946; which have
rather different gene structures, but produce very similar proteins.
However, there are no known endogenous targets of Tra2-&#945; and its
function is entirely unknown. Tra2-&#946; structure has been solved, but
not that of Tra2-&#945;. Here, we have modelled the structure of
Tra2-&#945; and compared its RNA binding specificities with that of
Tra2-&#946; using computational approaches. This will give us an idea as
to how related these proteins are at the structural level, and point out
functional differences, if any, as well as whether these two proteins are
co-expressed in humans or their expressions are spatially, temporally or
developmentally regulated.

classification of existing DNA-protein complexes. BMC Bioinformatics 13, 1
(2012). <br> Modulation of endocytosis in plants by salt stress. </br><br>We have ventured to analyze endocytic mechanisms in an intact functioning
tissue, the Arabidopsis root. Our previous data indicates that at least
two distinct mechanisms of endocytosis are constitutively operative in
the root : a clathrin-dependent pathway which endocytose transmembrane
proteins across all cell layers; and an epidermally restricted,
sterol-dependent, clathrin-independent pathway that takes up lipid and
lipid-anchored proteins but not transmembrane proteins. In this AWS, I
shall describe induction of a third endocytic pathway across all layers of
the root by salt stress. This third pathway presumably is
clathrin-independent, however it takes up cargo of the clathrin-dependent
pathway as well. The Rab-GEF , vps9a is an essential component of only
this induced pathway. We also observe the expansion of small acidic
compartments into larger vacuole-like structures in inner cell layers
under
saline stress. This correlates with salt-resistance, since the disruption
of this expansion of vacuolar system in a vps9a mutant results in
hypersensitivity to salt. Thus saline stress reprogrammes endocytic
pathways and also remodels a vital compartment involved in intracellular
trafficking. <br> Genetic differentiation in a fragmented landscape: impact of body
 size, trophic level and landscape structure </br><br>Habitat fragmentation, a prevalent feature of modern landscapes, can lead
to subdivision of populations into smaller units. Distribution of genetic
variation within and between these units depends on the species, unit size
and dispersal between the units. I am interested in looking at patterns of
genetic differentiation in different mammalian species in a fragmented
landscape. I will be presenting some preliminary results on predicting
genetic differentiation based on body size and trophic level of the
species and structural landscape connectivity. <br> Understanding the urea induced unfolding of SH3 domain of PI3
 kinase by HX-MS </br><br>Proteins are working horse of living cells. Once it got synthesized on
ribosomes, it starts acquiring its unique three dimensional (3D)
structures. This 3D structure of protein is not static; under native
conditions also, it undergoes random structural fluctuations. Random
structural fluctuations in protein might be local, sub-global or global.
Urea and guanidine hydrochloride are osmolytes that are widely used as
denaturant to study dynamics of protein folding. Mechanism by which they
destabilize native structure of protein is still not clear. I am working
on SH3 protein and try to understand the difference between both
denaturant. Our lab has previously observed that in presence and absent of
high denaturant (GndHCl), protein shows same kind of structural
heterogeneity studied by HX-MS. Since we already know the dynamics of SH3
in presence of high GndHCl, it would be good to study same protein (SH3)
dynamics in presence of Urea and correlate to understand molecular
mechanism for both denaturant. <br> Role of IP3 signalling in Neurons Regulating Nutrient Sensing </br><br>Neuronal circuits regulating nutrient sensing leading to altered feeding
behaviour are beginning to be mapped. Previous work in the lab with itpr
(Inositol 1,4,5-trisphophate receptor or the IP3R gene) mutants have shown
that IP3 signalling is necessary to survive metabolic stress in
Drosophila. IP3 signalling, an important response to a variety of
extracellular stimuli can be mediated by a variety of G protein coupled
receptors (GPCRs) which convert the extracellular message to a cellular
response. We have carried out a genetic screen for G protein coupled
receptors, in order to elucidate the signalling pathways involved in
neuronal circuit for IP3 mediated nutrient sensing mechanism. Our
preliminary data suggests that the ventral ganglion in the larvae harbours
a group of neurons that seem to be the primary responders to nutrient
deprivation. <br> Patterning of an active molecule on the cell surface and
 implications for cellular computation </br><br>I am interested in the mechanisms by which a diverse set of membrane
molecules dynamically template their organisation and the effects of such
mechanisms on the functional roles played by organisational structures,
e.g. signaling platforms. Building upon theoretical and experimental work
by our group that suggests a role for the active mechanics of cortical
actomyosin in the clustering of certain membrane molecules, I will be
building a framework within which to explore how molecules that are both
advected by and affect actomyosin currents might organise, within the
general oeuvre of active soft matter physics. This framework has
implications for issues of information transduction and processing at the
cell surface. <br> Prediction of unassigned regions in Mycobacterium tuberculosis
 genome and the modelling a peptide-protein complex of plant origin
 and docking study. </br><br>The talk is divided into two parts as follows.
The genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37Rv strain) has been observed
to contain a substantial portion of unassigned regions with no domain
information. As part of our involvement in the Open Source Drug Discovery
(OSDD) Consortium we approach annotating these unassigned regions using an
in-house developed computationally intensive bioinformatics algorithm PURE
(Prediction of Unassigned REgions).
The second part of the talk would focus on the molecular modelling and
docking of peptide-protein complex of plant origin. The bioactive peptide
AtPep1 was discovered as the first endogenous peptide elicitor in A.
thaliana involved in plant innate immunity. We present an approach to
carry out peptide-protein docking when there is no structural information
available for both the receptor and ligand. <br> A Systems Biology based approach to integrate functioning of
 Lipidome and Glycome with Genome, Transcriptome and Proteome </br><br>The knowledge of lipids of a cell is called the lipidome of the cell. The
knowledge of lipids of all the cells of an organism is called the lipidome
profile of that organism. Its study is called lipidomics. Similarly, the
knowledge of sugars in present in cells and organism is thus Glycome of
cells and organism respectively. Its study similarly called glycomics.
This projects aims at first finding the differentially regulated lipids in
different cell types of planaria and subsequently deciphering their roles
in regeneration and homeostasis of the organism. Then, we wish to look
into how these function in conjugation with transcriptome and the
proteome. <br> Genome wide survey of myosins in eukaryotic genomes </br><br>Myosins are a group of actin-based motor proteins that power muscle
contraction, as well as movement and load dependent anchoring on actin
filaments in all eukaryotic cells. The availability of the complete
protein sequences of several eukaryotic species makes it possible to carry
out a comprehensive analysis to examine the complexity and the
evolutionary relationships within the myosin family and identify newer
myosin classes in eukaryotes.
In this survey, we have employed, multi-fold computational approaches, to
investigate evolutionary and functional relationships between myosins in
diverse lineages. The analysis is aimed at understanding the distribution,
domain architecture and probable biological functions of the myosins in a
variety of eukaryotic lineages. <br> Organization and distribution of individual activity within
 foraging groups </br><br>Honeybees are social insects with a highly complex colony organization and
a specialized division of labour and tasks within the colony. Specific
groups of bees perform specific tasks, like nurse bees, foragers etc.
Nectar foragers are also site-specific and forage at the same site
repeatedly till the food source gets depleted, giving rise to foraging
groups. I am interested in understanding the dynamics of task division and
specialization amongst individuals in a foraging group in terms of
foraging and communication for recruitment. I would be presenting data
obtained from initial work done on *A.florea *and *A.mellifera *with
respect to dance activity of different individuals of the same nectar
foraging group. <br> DNA Nanostructures as bioimaging agents for Electron Microscopy </br><br>Recent advances in nanomaterials have produced a new class of fluorescent
labels called fluorescent noble-metal nanoclusters such as Au and Ag.
These noble metal nanoclusters typically possess size below 2 nm and have
been attractive for their unique role in bridging the 'missing link'
between atomic and nanoparticle behavior. DNA is used as one of the
stabilizing scaffold for metal nanoclusters. These metal nanoclusters have
been shown to be fluorescent with tunable emission in the presence of DNA
with very high photo stability and are non-toxic to cells. Hence DNA bound
to metal nanoclusters can be used as a probe for correlative microscopy as
metal nanoclusters are fluorescent and also these are contrast agents for
electron microcopy. Unique advantage of this metal nanocluster is that the
underlying DNA scaffold can be used to target fluorescent nanoclusters to
sub cellular location using a recombinant protein-DNA interface. Previous
work in the lab has demonstrated a functional DNA binding protein (scFv)
which can bind to a DNA sequence with very high affinity and that this
protein can be conjugated to various cellular trafficking proteins like
Furin intend to use novel DNA scaffolds as targeting entities to study
Trans Golgi Network (TGN) of Golgi apparatus of mammalian cells and
correlate it with the structural integrity of Trans Golgi network. Thus,
we aim to achieve high resolution structural as well as temporal
information of the TGN as DNA bound to scFv on luminal domain of furin
using the correlative microscopy by DNA based nanodevices. In my AWS, I
will show the synthesis of DNA stabilized Ag nanoclusters, its
fluorescence properties only in the presence of DNA and its photo
stability at different pH rang. <br> A high throughput exome sequencing approach to analyse events
 within a good responder CML Patient under imatinib at diagnosis
 and under remission </br><br>We have undertaken a whole exome sequence of a BCR?ABL positive patient
with CML under treatment with Imatinib, who has been responding to a dose
of 200 mg once a day or sometimes on alternate day because of symptomatic
neutropenia, for two years with no disease progression, both clinically
and molecularly. The exome sequencing of the bone marrow aspirate was
performed at the time of diagnosis and two years post treatment with
Imatinib. Matched skin biopsy was used as a control. This study has been
approved by the Institutional Ethical Review Board of St. John's Medical
college and Hospital. The aim of this study is to identify novel
polymorphisms or variants associated with the case, there by resisting the
disease to progress.
Results
We observe severe genome instability in terms of single nucleotide
variants (SNVs) at the time of diagnosis. The counts of SNVs are observed
to be drastically reduced in the treated bone marrow sample than at the
time of diagnosis. No insertions or deletions were observed in this
longitudinal case study. The SNVs picked up by exome sequencing were
contrasted at the stage of diagnosis and post treatment. We have
identified novel mutations within the ABL, BCR, Kit and NOTCH genes with
high probability of impact on function in the bone marrow sample at
diagnosis. These will further be validated experimentally to be confirmed
as a probable marker for screening patients. <br> Simulations of collapsed polymers as a simple model of bacterial
 nucleoids </br><br>The DNA in the E. coli cell is confined in a DNA-protein structure called 
Nucleoid clearly identificable using phase-contrast microscopy or electron
micrographs. The nucleoid occupies 1/6th of the cell volume and is the
region where active processes such as transcription and replication
happen. The interaction with cytoplasm and nucleoid associated proteins
seems fundamental to understand the nucleoid conformation.Using
montecarlo simulations and polymer physics we approach the problems of 
nucleoid compactness, macrodomain formations and presence of H-NS foci. <br> Structural mechanism utilized by the NS3-NS5 complex of Japanese
Encephalitis Virus to replicate the viral genome. </br><br>Japanese encephalitis virus(JEV) is a neurotropic virus and is the leading
cause of viral encephalitis in the world. ?JEV belongs to genus
Flavivirusand the genome is composed of a single stranded positive sense
RNA molecule.The genome of JEV is about 11kb long with a
5?cap(m7G5?ppp5?A) and no polyA tail at 3? end. The virally-encoded NS3
and NS5 proteins are centrally involved in the replication of viral
genome. ?TheNS3 houses a protease activity in the N- terminal region and a
RNA helicase activity in the C-terminal part.NS5 possesses a
methyltransferase activity and aRNA-dependent-RNA Polymerase activity in
the N- and C-terminal regions, respectively. The NS3 and NS5 proteins
associate to form a complex that may represent the minimal replisome and
serves to generate multiple copies of the progeny genome. Using
structural, biochemical and biophysical tools I aim to discern how the
multiple enzyme activitiesin the minimal replisome are coordinated to
synthesize copies of the viral genome. The progress made towards this end
will be presented. <br> Understanding Dynamics of Lek mating system in Blackbucks </br><br>Lek mating is a rare mating system in which males of a species gather
together on a common display ground (Lek) to attract females. Blackbucks
are one of the few (9) mammalian species that show lek mating behavior. In
blackbucks, 95% of the matings occur in the centre of the lek, showing a
female preference for males occupying this position. Female bias towards
males in the centre of the lek can result in a highly skewed variance in
male reproductive success and a consequent decrease in genetic variation
in the population. My first objective is to determine if such a variation
exists and its consequences, using genetic tools. My second objective is
to understand the role of chemical signaling, an important signaling
system in mammals, in determining female bias in mate choice. My study
will be conducted in Tal chappar, Rajasthan for six mating seasons over a
period of three years. <br> Computational approaches for the analysis of protein interactomics </br><br>Interactomicsis the study of interactions,the whole set of molecular
interaction in cellsinvolving physical interaction and indirect
interactions among molecules and genes. Protein interactome can provide
more information about the functional links and the functional context of
the proteins which are not apparent from protein sequence analysis or
protein expression analysis. The significance of this information for
systems biology and drug development rises with the increase in the size
of protein interaction data and with the availability of protein
interactomes.
Domain-domain and protein-protein interactions are being analysed from
abiochemical and evolutionary perspective.Work is centred on the alignment
of distantly related domains in PASS2 database and the role of outliers
(which are the extremely deviant members in a superfamily). Work focuses
on the analysis of function annotation and biological relevance of
outliers using Gene Ontology and other resources. On-going work about a
map or a network of domain interactionswill be introduced for better
understanding of the structural interactome and in predicting the off-site
interactions of drug candidates. <br> Structural and Biochemical characterization of DNA Polymerase V
 from Escherichia coli. </br><br>DNA Polymerases belonging to the Y-family serve to rescue replication
stalled at damaged nucleotides by carrying out trans-lesion DNA synthesis
(TLS). Among members of this family, DNA Polymerase V from Escherichia
coli and related organisms represents an unusual member. The E. coli PolV
is made up of three subunits- one copy of the polypeptide product of the
umuc gene and two copies of a truncated polypeptide product of the umud
gene, forming an unique heterotrimeric (UmuCD?2) architecture . This
enzyme is encoded by a very tightly regulated umuDC operon and expressed
late during the SOS response. I aim to carry out structural and
biochemical studies on PolV to elucidate the mechanism of translesion DNA
synthesis. <br> Studying the role of protein kinase d(pkd) in drosophila
 melanogaster </br><br>Protein Kinase D (also known as PKC?) is a Serine-Threonine Kinase
belonging to the subfamily of Calcium/Calmodulin Kinases. It is an
evolutionary conserved kinase with structure, function and regulation
different from the PKC family members. It is known to regulate a variety
of fundamental biological properties like signal transduction, cell
differentiation, proliferation, membrane trafficking, secretory transport
from the Trans Golgi network to the Plasma membrane, immune regulation,
angiogenesis and cancer. In Drosophila there is a single PKD orthologue
and its broad expression profile might indicate a more general role in
development and signaling pathways. Apart from roles in cell survival and
apoptosis, PKD also has roles in regulation of Golgi apparatus. The
molecular composition of transport carriers departing from the TGN to
other cellular destinations is still unclear though there has been reports
that the plasma membrane bound cargoes are transported in specialized
vesicles called CABS and it requires PKD for its biogenesis. The broad aim
of my study is to find out the role of Drosophila PKD in transport from
the trans Golgi network to the plasma membrane and the requirement of
different Phsophoinositide kinases in regulating the process. I would be
presenting the preliminary work done in this regard and will be discussing
the phenotypes of PKD mutants. I would also be discussing the strategy
used for generating PKD knockout in Drosophila and PKD specific antibody. <br> Mechanistic insights into the design of the first nucleic acid
 based chloride sensor </br><br>Our lab has designed nucleic acid based sensors for small molecule/ion.
Some of them have already been shown to perform quantitatively in vitro as
well as in vivo. Clensor is a DNA scaffolds based ratiometric sensor for
chloride. It combines the sensing property of small molecule fluorophore
as well as modularity and targetibility of DNA scaffolds. To improve
its chloride sensitivity, the design of the nucleic acid scaffold has been
optimized based on chemical intuitions as well experimental results in the
fluorescent intensity domain.
In my current project, using fluorescence lifetime based measurements, we
have now provided a quantitative and mechanistic insight into the
rationale behind the design of the sensor. These mechanistic principles
can be generalized as and be used as basis for designing any nucleic acid
based sensor. <br> Single nucleotide polymorphisms help regain fitness lost due to
multiple synonymous changes in a functional gene. </br><br>Synonymous mutations in the highly expressed functionally important
Formaldehyde-activating enzyme (fae)gene in Methylobacteriumextorquens AM1
have a large effect on fitness. Loss of fitness is mainly due to reduced
gene expression and enzyme production. When evolved in the laboratory
under continuous selection for increased Fae production, these mutants
rapidly regained fitness. Sequencing revealed Single Nucleotide
Polymorphisms (SNPs), both synonymous and non-synonymous, in the fae gene
and its upstream region.
The focus of this study is to understand the contribution of these SNPs
and the evolved genomic background to fitness. I have generated strains
which help dissect out the effect of the SNP and genomic background and
looked at their growth rate and Faeprotein levels. The SNPs which arose in
a given mutant never arose in other mutants. I am testing the hypothesis
that they are beneficial only in the context of the fae sequence in which
they arose, by creating the SNPs in backgrounds in which they could have
arisen but did not.
Synonymous mutations in different mutants had a common effect on
phenotype: growth defect due to reduced enzyme production. This study
shows that there can be multiple solutions to fix this problem, and
multiple ways in which an organism can adapt when a functionally important
gene is perturbed.? <br> Stochasticity in small bistable topologies and effect of
 structural plasticity on dendritic spine biochemistry. </br><br>Learning and Memory storage in the brain is a long-standing fundamental
problem, and still garners very active interest from the field of
neuroscience. The most accepted speculation correlates it with a process
known as synaptic plasticity. Synaptic processes are structurally
localized in dendritic micro-structures called spines, and learning leads
to changes in synaptic weights, often correlated with change in spinal
volumes. There are several models on the molecular basis of plasticity,
but quantitative effects of plastic spine morphology on biochemical
signaling is not understood. We intend to build this up the from a
physical system of induction and sustenance of memory in bistable chemical
reaction space, or small network topologies, and extend this to the
physiological terminals of neurons. With this bottom-up approach, we will
try to understand chemical reaction systems in general, neuronal spines in
specific and attempt to address the problem posed above. <br> Towards understanding the translation of wingless endocytosis
 into positional information within Drosophila wing imaginal disc </br><br>Morphogen gradients confer positional information to a developing field of
cells. The observed exponential decay of morphogens produced from a
localized source (like Dpp or Wg in the wing imaginal disc) is
rationalized by a theoretical model involving diffusion and degradation of
morphogens across the developing field. Several elegant experiments in the
past, trying to evaluate this model, have experimentally quantified
diffusion coefficient of morphogens although assuming a spatially uniform
degradation rate across their domain. However, this assumption has been
questioned through recent work from our laboratory, where the endocytosis
rate of Wg (and possibly degradation) has been shown to vary across the
wing imaginal disc. I am interested in evaluating the reasons that
determine this spatially varying pattern of endocytosis and thus, better
understand the function of endocytosis in transforming morphogen
gradients. <br> Length variation analysis of protein domain superfamilies
 amongst sequence homologues </br><br>During evolution, proteins tend to accumulate many mutations which cause a
change in their length, structure and increase their functional diversity.
Domain comparisons have shown that structural variation is influenced by
the number, length and location of insertions and deletions of residues
(indels) and length variations can be from 2-3 residues to 2-fold of the
domain size. Length variations at protein domain level have been known to
cause functional impacts like, increasing structural stability,
diversifying substrate specificity etc. Here we present a comprehensive
resource of length variant protein domains at superfamily level (LenVarDB)
which will help users trace length variations/indels in their protein
domain of interest. LenVarDB attempts (for the first time) to include
sequence information, by gathering homologues of superfamily members and
deriving indels from their multiple sequence alignment. Detection of
multiple length variants (indels) along with their spatial orientation in
a given query protein structure, could be very useful in highlighting the
deviations caused from its usual structure and function. We also focus on
one case study where using molecular dynamics we intend to investigate the
structural and functional effects of 20 residue insert in a unique DNA
polymerase, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). <br> Mechanism of fibroblast activation in mouse model of fibrosis </br><br>Under normal physiological conditions fibroblasts are responsible for
maintaining structural integrity of the connective tissue by secretion of
extracellular matrix (ECM). During wound healing, fibroblasts migrate to
the wound site and differentiate into the activated form called
myofibroblasts. The myofibroblasts then secrete ECM proteins, and
cytokines that regulate the behavior of multiple cells in the tissue and
contract to close the wound. However in pathological conditions like
fibrosis and cancer there is an increase in number of activated
fibroblasts that play a critical role in disease progression.
Overexpression of the transcription factor Snail is seen in both cancer
and fibrosis. Snail is known to induce epithelial to mesenchymal
transition (EMT), making it a ?favorite? candidate implicated in increase
in number of myofibroblasts in cancer and fibrosis. Our lab has developed
a mouse model for dermal fibrosis by overexpressing Snail in epidermis to
understand the pathophysiology of fibrotic conditions. Contrary to the
prevailing model, preliminary data from our lab shows that it is not Snail
via the EMT that causes increase in myofibroblast but soluble factors
secreted by the Snail expressing keratinocytes in the epidermis that leads
to this phenotype. Mindin, a member of F-Spondin family of proteins is one
such soluble factor. The aim of my project is to understand the mechanism
of fibroblast activation through Mindin. <br> A binary model of the eukaryotic vesicle traffic system </br><br>Eukaryotic cells are composed of compartments, which are membrane bound
collections of molecules, characterized by their compositions.
Compartments exchange molecules, called cargo, amongst each other using
the traffic system. Cargo is sent from the source to the target
compartment in carriers called vesicles. Sorting of cargo, budding of
vesicles and its fusion with the correct target compartment are all
brought about by interactions amongst the molecules which act as the
active machinery of the traffic system. The dynamics of molecular traffic
imparts to the cell a distribution of various cargo molecules across
compartments at any instant of time, which can be seen as its phenotype.
 In the model, we have encoded sorting, budding and fusion as binary
rules. Compartments in the cell constantly gain and lose molecules due to
budding and fusion of vesicles as determined by the rules, therefore
leading to a change in the state of the cell. These dynamics lead the
cell to steady states; oscillations characterized by their time-period
and compartment compositions. The model gives us a method of mapping
rules; the genotype of the traffic system, to the steady states reached
by cells and their attributes; the phenotype. <br> Analysis of domain swapping in proteins </br><br>3D-domain swapping is an oligomerization mechanism which involves exchange
of structural elements between monomeric subunits. A flexible linker
region, also called as hinge, is crucial for this exchange. Although
domain swapping was first observed in 1962, very little is known about the
sequence and structural signatures. This mechanism is neither protein
class-specific nor organism-specific. In some cases, domain-swapped
oligomers acquire allosteric regulatory function or additional stability
after oligomerization. Oligomer formation through 3D-domain swapping might
be a key step in amyloid formation.
In my talk, I will be explaining about our analysis carried out on domain
swapped molecules in two aspects, ?hotspot residues for interaction? and
?effects of pH on the oligomerisation?. Hotspot residues are identified
using their distinguishing features like conservation, interaction energy
contribution, location (spatial clustering) and types of interacting
partners. This algorithm is applied on all available domain-swapped
molecules derived from our inhouse 3Dswapplus repository and critical
regions for domain swapping were checked for their distribution.
In another project, we computationally analyzed effects of pH on the
domain-swapping process and proposed a model for the pH-dependent domain
swapping mechanism. In this mechanism, changing pH may induce domain
swapping in some molecules (E.g.: diphtheria toxin, domain-swapped dimer
at pH-3.6 and monomer at pH-7). During this study, different key regions
for domain swapping viz. domain-swapped interface (DSI) and non-swapped
interface (NSI) were extensively analysed and compared in 16 observed
pH-dependent domain-swapped molecules. This study also revealed potential
predictive characteristics of pH modification required to induce domain
swapping in monomeric structures. <br> Vesicular release of Sonic Hedgehog </br><br>The Hedgehog family of proteins encodes highly conserved morphogens
involved in patterning of developing tissues. Hedgehog (Hh) proteins are
post-translationally modified by cholesterol at the C-terminus, and
palmitate at the N-terminus. These lipid modifications are thought to
anchor the morphogen to the plasma membrane of cells that produce Hh,
making the release and transport of this membrane-anchored morphogen an
important regulatory step in the delivery of Hh to receptive target cells.
We are interested in understanding the mechanisms of efficient release of
this membrane-anchored morphogen as it represents a key stage in the
signaling cascade that eventually leads to Hh-dependent control of
morphogenesis and differentiation. Our recent results suggest that Sonic
Hedgehog is released in two different types of vesicular pools with
overlapping but distinct protein composition. Ongoing experiments are
focused on deciphering the molecular players involved in generating these
distinct vesicular pools of Sonic hedgehog. Current experiments testing
the paracrine signaling capability of the two types of Hh vesicle will be
presented. <br> Prediction of 3D-domain swapping from protein sequences by random
 forest approach. </br><br>3D-domain swapping is a mechanism of protein oligomerization where two or
more identical protein molecules associate by exchanging identical
structural elements, such that their native intra-molecular interactions
are replaced by their intermolecular counterparts. Proteins involved in
domain swapping are also reported to be involved in conformational
diseases. We had developed database earlier with 293 PDB entries of
3D-domain swapped proteins with extensive literature curation. In my
previous AWS, I described about updation of this database, which we called
as 3DSwapplus, having 2057 PDB entries.
In this AWS, I am going to discuss about the analysis performed on
3DSwapplus data. I am also going to discuss about postive and negative
dataset creation by best representative profile approach. This is one-time
computer-intensive search of best representatives of protein families,
starting from the central repository of protein domain families, the PFAM
database. Further, different sequence features of these proteins were used
to develop a random forest model for prediction of 3D-domain swapping. The
evaluation of the model and its application on different proteomes
including human proteome will be discussed. Prediction or early
identification of proteins engaged in domain swapping might help to target
genes involved in deposition and neurodegenerative diseases. <br> Mitochondrial trafficking in touch receptor neurons of C.elegans </br><br>Mitochondrial transport is crucial for neuronal development and
maintenance. Long distance mitochondrial transport occurs along
microtubule tracks mediated by the molecular motors kinesins and dynein.
Previous studies from our lab show that the density of mitochondria is
fixed and their distribution is regulated such that two mitochondria have
a low probability of being closer than 3um in the neuronal process of the
adult touch receptor neurons of C. elegans. These observations led us to
attempt an identification of molecular players using forward genetics that
regulate mitochondrial density.
We have isolated mutants showing fewer mitochondria in touch receptor
neurons. This complementation group has multiple phenotypes: (i) no
mitochondria at synapses, (ii) synaptic vesicle markers are also absent
from synapses and (iii) defects in acetylation of tubulin. All three
phenotypes suggest that this gene is likely to play a general role in
transport rather than a specific role only in mitochondrial transport We
investigated the dynamics of mitochondria in the touch neuron process to
begin understanding (i) how mitochondrial distribution patterns develop
(ii) and to study the potentially altered transport properties in our
mutants. My results show that mitochondria in neurons are highly dynamic
however flow between the cell body and the neuronal process is slow. Our
preliminary results suggest that new stationary mitochondrial positions
are added throughout neuronal process during the development. <br> Structure and function of the E. coli galactose regulatory network </br><br>The gene regulatory networks that underlie sugar metabolism in E. coli are
among the most well characterized networks in mathematical biology. Most
of these networks share similar topologies, with the exception of the
galactose regulatory network. This network displays an unusual level of
complexity, in that its genes are regulated at the levels of transcription
and translation, as well as through small-molecule feedback interactions.
The goal of my work is to understand the fluctuating galactose
environments in which the kinetics of this unusually complex network
allows E. coli to flourish. Our approach involves constructing a model of
this network, which would allow us to simulate growth curves of E. coli in
an arbitrary nutrient environment. Currently, the model I have built
successfully explains the observed in vivo kinetics of the network, and is
at a stage where testable predictions of its kinetics can be made. <br> Molecular modeling of 100 olfactory receptors </br><br>Olfactory receptors (ORs) are a subclass of class A GPCRs, which are
important for odour recognition in species ranging from yeasts to mammals.
Binding of odorants to different ORs leads to a combinatorial code which
is responsible for recognition of more than 10,000 different odorants in
mammals. This diversity is reflected in OR genes which make up 3% of the
total gene content. Most ORs remain orphan, i.e. knowledge of the specific
odorants to which they bind is presently lacking. In the absence of any
experimentally elucidated structure, the relations between specific
odours, odorants and their olfactory receptors still remains a mystery.
Our lab has been working towards the solution to this problem by
generating Database of Olfactory Receptors (DOR) which aims to provide
useful information at the sequence, phylogeny and structure level. My work
in updating this database includes finding the consensus of the best
methods for transmembrane helix prediction and also finding the best
query-template alignment for homology modelling of ORs. As a result of
this work, we have come up with active and inactive models for 100 OR
sequences from five model organisms annotated with conservation scores and
dimer interface predictions. This resource will be useful in understanding
the mechanism of odour perception. <br> Using CREB overexpression to track systems consolidation of an
 allocated memory trace </br><br>Despite being initially proposed over a century ago, the idea that
declarative memories undergo a process of systems memory consolidation,
whereby they are exported from their original site of storage in the
hippocampus to other parts of the cortex, remains controversial. The
following study seeks to resolve this controversy by using CREB
overexpression to bias allocation of a given memory tospecific subsets of
neurons that are optogenetically-targetable. This approach will allow the
role of these different subsets of neurons,located in different brain
regions, in expression of the memory to be dissected with unprecedented
specificity through optogenetic excitation at different time points, thus,
resolving a long-standing debate. Towards this end, we have packaged
several lentivirus constructs that will be useful: lenti
CMV::hChR2-mCherry, lenti CMV::hChR2-mCherry-2A-EGFP-CREB, and lenti
CMV::hChR2(C128S)-EYFP-2A-VChR1-mCherry. Here we first show that all
three of these packaged lentivirusesare functional and have a high titer. 
We then show the results of experiments that we conducted to
examinewhether neurons infected with these viruses in vivo are
optogenetically-excitable. This latter work was carried outin the context
of performing control experiments for a project examining the sufficiency
of reactivation of a subset of neurons towards which memory allocation has
been biased in the expression of memory for cued fear conditioning and the
sufficiency of increased neuronal excitability in biasing such memory. <br> Understanding The Pathways Involved in Wound-healing
 Response </br><br>The wound-healing program is a complex biological process where
associations of different cell types and their effective communication
with each other is necessary. These intercellular interactions are
important to rapidly rebuild an injured tissue and restore its compromised
function. In the field of wound healing an overlooked question is the
mechanism(s) by which cells sense the injury and initiate a healing
response. As part of this sensing mechanism, another relevant area of
investigation is to understand the regulatory factors involved in this
wound-healing program. Previous lab research has shown that
down-regulation of caspase 8 at the wound site is an important process in
order to initiate and sustain the wound-healing response. Failure to
down-regulate caspase 8 in response to an injury, as seen in case of
diabetic mouse [unpublished], leads to perturbed wound healing.
Down-regulation of caspase 8 expression has also been shown to be common
in various cancers, and is accomplished at the genetic and epigenetic
levels. Comparing the mutual machineries involved in wound healing and
cancer, our current focus is to explore the epigenetic regulators of
caspase 8 expression during wound-response and also to tackle the
unexplored mechanisms by which cells sense the injury, which ultimately
initiates wound response. <br> Identifying novel genes in the synaptic vesicle transport pathway </br><br>Axonal transport is an important process required for various
developmental phenomena such as synapse formation, synapse maintenance and
hence neuronal function One of the major cargos transported in neurons are
pre-synaptic vesicles (PSVs) carrying neurotransmitters and SNAREs, which
play an essential role in synaptic transmission. The major anterograde
motor that transports PSVs in axons in C. elegans is UNC-104 (Kinesin-3).
To identify new genes in the PSV transport pathway, I have performed an
enhancer screen targeted to the UNC-104 dependent PSV transport using a
hypomorph of unc-104 previously isolated in the lab. The criteria for my
2-step enhancer screen were worsened behavior in the worm and altered PSV
distribution in a subset of neurons. Of the 16 mutants thus obtained, I
have separated three allelic groups from the unc-104 mutation and they
have varied effects on PSV distribution along the axon as well as reduced
presence in the synapse. I am now in the process of finding the effect of
these mutants on distribution of other cargo and the UNC-104 motor. <br> Monitoring chain collapse of monellin using a continuous flow setup </br><br>The folded state of a protein is more compact than an unfolded form and
contains structural elements such as helices, b sheets and turns. There is
greater than threefold decrease in volume during the folding process.The
reduction in volume during protein folding is akin to the coil to globule
transition in polymer physics. When a polymer is transferred to a poor
solvent (which does not interact with the polymer) the polymer will
undergo compaction due to intra chain interactions which is known as coil
to globule transition or collapse.
My aim was to characterize the collapse transition during protein folding.
The model protein used in the study is Single Chain Monellin (MNEI), with
FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) as a probe to monitor
specific distances within the protein structure which change due to the
compaction. Refolding of the protein was initiated by rapidly diluting the
denaturant into native buffer using a stopped flow mixer. Polypeptide
collapse manifests itself as a burst phase loss of signal within the dead
time of 6 milliseconds, in a stopped flow. In order to monitor the rapid
events during collapse directly, a continuous flow setup with a dead time
of ~35 ?s has been constructed. With the help of the home-made continuous
flow setup the ultrafast compaction rate of MNEI have been measured at
different denaturant concentrations. <br> Identification of candidate neurotransmitters and neuromodulators
 involved in regulating daily foraging behavior in Honeybees </br><br>The honeybee foraging trip is a complex yet robust sequence of actions
that can be used as a model to study regulation of behavior. During the
foraging trip the honeybee has to make multiple decisions. A number of
internal and external factors affect these behavioral decisions and it is
known that these factors exert their effects through substances called
neuromodulators. So far, studies have been done where some
neurotransmitters have been shown to be involved in regulating behavior
that is maintained over many days. I aim to identify those that are
involved in regulating behavior that changes over a few minutes. This
would lead to a greater understanding of the effects of neuromodulation in
an almost perfectly natural context. <br> Kinetic barriers in the folding of human alpha1-antitrypsin to
alternate native conformations </br><br>Serine protease inhibitors (serpins) are suicide inhibitors of
serine proteases. A serpin inhibits a protease by irreversibly disrupting
the protease active site. The mechanism of serpin inhibition is coupled to
a large conformational change in which it transitions from an active to an
inactive state. The inactive state is observed to be thermodynamically
more stable than the active (default) state. Therefore, in order to be
functionally active, a newly synthesized, unfolded serpin must fold to the
less stable (active) state, and avoid folding to the more stable
(inactive) state. It has been previously hypothesized that selective
folding to the active state is facilitated by the presence of larger
kinetic barriers in folding to the inactive state. To test this
hypothesis, we have used structure based models and molecular dynamics
simulations to map the folding energy landscapes of both the active and
inactive states of a well studied serpin ? human alpha1-antitrypsin
(alpha1-AT). We find that the kinetic barrier for an unfolded alpha1-AT to
fold to the inactive state is several kBT higher than folding to the
active state. In addition, folding to the active state involves the
formation of a productive on-pathway intermediate (IA). The structure of
this intermediate agrees well with the structural regions that fold early
in previous refolding experiments probed by pulsed labeling hydrogen
exchange mass spectrometry. Interestingly, the transition state (TSI) in
folding to the inactive state is about 11 kBT higher in energy (i.e. Less
stable) than IA despite having similar structural content. We find that
this difference in stability arises due to a large entropic stabilization
of IA relative to TSI. Our results suggest that despite the lower
thermodynamic stability of the active state, a larger kinetic barrier to
fold to the inactive state allows an unfolded serpin to fold correctly to
its active state. <br> Intracellular Calcium Signals in Dopaminergic Neurons Shape the
Neural Circuit for Drosophila Flight. </br><br>Normal animal behavior requires that the nervous system
integrate sensory information, process it and relay it to the motor
machinery. To understand the molecular basis of neural mechanisms
underlying behavior, we study how changes in intracellular calcium
signaling affect Drosophila flight. Ca2+ is released from intracellular
stores upon generation of the second messenger, Inositol 1,4,5
triphosphate (IP3) in response to extracellular cues. Within the cell IP3
binds to the IP3R, which is a ligand-gated Ca2+ channel present on
membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum. Previous work from our group has
shown that viable Drosophila mutants for the IP3R and flies with
pan-neuronal knockdown of IP3R, are flightless (1, 2). We have now
investigated both the temporal and spatial specificity for intracellular
calcium signaling in Drosophila flight. The spatial specificity has been
investigated in various classes of neurons, including peptidergic,
glutamatergic, serotonergic (3) and
dopaminergic.
Perturbation of IP3R, store operated calcium entry or synaptic activity in
dopaminergic neurons results in erroneous left-right wing coordination
during flight (4) and a loss of dopamine positive neurons in the adult
thoracic ganglion. Temporal studies have revealed that the requirement is
during early pupal development (5). Our study suggests that IP3R signaling
and store operated calcium entry are important in dopaminergic
interneurons for maintaining the neurotransmitter identity (6). The
results will be presented in this AWS.

III. <br> Role of 5-HT2A in the action of antipsychotics. </br><br>Antipsychotic drugs have an essential role in the treatment of
Schizophrenia and are also used in other psychiatric disorders. Though
antipsychotics have been in use from the 1950s, and have revolutionized
the treatment of Schizophrenia, there are severe side effects associated
with their use. In some cases the side-effects are severe enough that
patients sometime discontinue the treatment. There continues to be limited
knowledge about the mechanisms of antipsychotic-induced side effects and
also how they bring about their clinical effects.
GPCRs of serotonergic systems, particularly serotonin receptor type 2A
(5-HT2A), is strongly implicated in the action of antipsychotics. Most
existing antipsychotics antagonize the 5-HT2A and some of them are
believed to target this receptor more than any other. To explore the
function of the 5-HT2A in greater detail, in vivo, we have generated a
global 5-HT2A knockout mouse. This knockout mouse should serve as a
reasonable model system to study the interaction of 5-HT2A with
antipsychotics. It would allow us to examine alterations in the
biochemistry of Htr2a-/- mouse brain, with and without antipsychotic
treatment. In this AWS, I will talk about my experiments that examine the
role of 5-HT2A on the physiological/behavioral effects of Clozapine ? an
atypical antipsychotic, in mice. I will also discuss the global mRNA
changes seen in the cortical tissue of Htr2a-/- and Htr2a+/+ mice on
treatment with different antipsychotics.
II. <br> Drosophila septin, Pnut is a modulator of neuronal Store 
Operated Calcium Entry and flight. </br><br>Store operated Calcium entry (SOCE) is a conserved mechanism
for uptake of extracellular calcium, following depletion of the
intracellular stores. We have previously demonstrated a critical
requirement of SOCE during development of the neuronal circuit governing
flight in Drosophila. This deficit in the development of the circuit
results in flight defects in adult organisms. Septins have recently been
identified as coordinators of SOCE in HeLa and Jurkat T cells. Using 
air-puff induced flight behavior in adult animals and direct measurement
of SOCE from primary neuronal cultures, we uncover a genetic interaction
of Pnut with inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor and STIM. These 
proteins play crucial roles in the signaling pathway involved in agonist
induced depletion of intracellular stores and SOCE. The findings of this
study shows Pnut as a modulator of SOCE in neurons and demonstrates a
novel role for this protein in post-mitotic neurons for regulation of
flight behavior in adults. <br> Advantageous mutations facilitate the recovery in fitness lost due
to multiple synonymous mutations in a functionally important gene in
Methylobacteriumextorquens AM1. </br><br>A study by Agashe et al (2012) demonstrated that synonymous
mutations in the highly expressed and functionally indispensable
Formaldehyde-activating enzyme (fae) gene in Methylobacteriumextorquens
AM1 have a large effect on fitness. This effect was mainly due to reduced
fae gene expression and enzyme production. These mutants, when evolved in
the laboratory under continuous selection for increased fae production,
evolved a significantly higher growth rate within ~ 250 generations.
Sequencing revealed presence ofmutations in the upstream region of fae in
two mutantsand these mutations were never replicated across different
synonymous mutants of fae.
The focus of the current study is to understand the contribution of the
mutations in the non-coding region of fae to the fitness. We want to test
the hypothesis that they are beneficial only in the context of the fae
sequence in which they arose.Also we want to address the question of when
and how these mutations arose during the evolution experiment.Whole genome
sequencing of the evolved populations revealed some mutations in their
genomesand we want to assess the contributions of these mutations to
fitness. We demonstrate here that there can be multiple ways to fix the
problem of reduced fitness due to mutated fae, and different modes in
which an organism can adapt when a functionally important gene is
perturbed.
III <br> Elucidating the molecular basis of ligand-binding in wild type
Sandercyanin and its monomer mutants </br><br>Far-red fluorescent proteins have become extremely popular
tools for deep imaging of animal tissues and for studying protein
localization and protein-proteins interactions in living cells. Here we
report Sandercyanin, a far- red &#64258;uorescent protein from blue
walleye, which has enhanced fluorescence on binding to biliverdin, an
endogenous ligand found in all mammalian cells. X-ray crystal structure of
native Sandercyanin showed that the protein exists as a homo-tetramer with
a molecular weight of 81kDa, with one biliverdin molecule bound to each
monomer. We have also discovered that Sandercyanin undergoes ligand
induced tetramerization from monomer apo- protein to tetramer bound form.
We have engineered mutations to make monomer with very similar fluorescent
properties and solved the crystal structures of all of them.
Interestingly, X-ray crystal structures of the mutant proteins show
significant differences in the mode of biliverdin from? the wild type
protein.
II. <br> Structural and biochemical analysis of DNA lesion bypass by the
prokaryotic DNA Polymerase IV </br><br>A number of genotoxic chemicals react with the N2- atom of
deoxyguanosine resulting in the appearance of minor groove adducts of this
nucleotide- a majority of which can block replication. DNA Polymerase IV
or PolIV (Escherichia coli) is a translesion bypass DNA polymerase that
serves to rescue replication stalled at damaged nucleotides. The
N2-furfuryl adduct of guanine (fdG) arises due to the action of the
antibiotic nitrofurazone and serves as a model N2- deoxyguanosine adduct.
PolIV is known to bypass this adduct with high accuracy and incorporates
dCTP against fdG with higher catalytic proficiency than opposite to an
undamaged dG. This property considerably reduces the sensitivity of E.coli
to nitrofurazone. We have determined three structures of functional
complexes of this enzyme in complex with DNA containing N2-furfuryl adduct
at the templating and two different downstream positions. These structures
provide snapshots of the enzyme in the incorporation and extension modes
during translesion bypass of the fdG adduct. The structures and allied
enzymology and functional data allow formulation of a simple and elegant
mechanism for the observed accurate and efficient translesion synthesis by
PolIV past replication-blocking N2-deoxyguanine adducts. <br> Structure of pri-miRNA 17-92a cluster and its possible implications </br><br>MicroRNAs control gene expression either by transcript
degradation or translational repression. Expression of these miRNAs are
highly regulated in tissues and any misregulation leads to diseased
condition. But the mechanism of regulation is still largely unknown. It is
becoming evident that regulation is achieved in many cases during miRNA
biogenesis. To investigate this we took a long polycistronic primary miRNA
transcript containing six miRNAs with diverse function. This cluster
called pri-miR-17-92a undergoes differential processing to produce
different levels of mature miRNAs. We considered the hypothesis that
tertiary structure of this transcript could result in asymmetric
processing at the very initial stages. Thus we first investigated the
existence of any higher order structure formation by this transcript.
Earlier I have shown using SHAPE analysis, hydroxyl radical foot printing
as well as bulk biophysical methods that pri-miR-17-92a adopts a specific
three dimensional architecture with solvent inaccessible regions in an
Mg2+ dependent manner. Now in this AWS, I will show the secondary
structure of the whole cluster which I could elucidate using a fast acting
reagent, benzoyl cyanide. I will also show hydroxyl radical footprint
analysis done on the whole cluster which revealed extensive solvent
protected regions. Further DMS probing of the cluster yielded the
Hoogsteen base pairing sites in the pri-miRNA that mediate tertiary
contacts. This secondary structural map not only provides a means to
deduce the tertiary structure but also indicates how protein binding could
modulate processing in a context dependent manner. Using such
biochemically derived pri-miRNA structure one could gain important
insights about DGCR8 recognition of pri-miRNA helix.

II. <br> Cytoskeleton interacting adaptor proteins template membrane
organization of transmembrane proteins. </br><br>Plasma membrane (PM) is a bilayer made up of lipids and
proteins. There is mounting evidence that suggests both active and passive
mechanisms function to organize components of the plasma membrane. The
underlying actin cytoskeleton dynamics appears to be a major player in the
mechanics of organization of components of the plasma membrane. It is
known that the components of plasma membrane interact with the
cytoskeleton directly or indirectly via adaptor molecules. Work from our
laboratory has shown that GPI anchored proteins form nanoscale clusters
sensitive to cholesterol as well as actin dynamics (1, 2). The description
of the interaction between components of the plasma membrane and the
acto-myosin network via adaptor molecules such as cytoskeleton interacting
proteins is far from being complete.
 The focus of my work is to identify novel cytoskeleton interacting
proteins which functions as a regulator of the membrane organization and
probe their functionality in the cell system. We have generated chimeric
protein tool to study these interactions (FKBP-FRB system : where FK506
binding protein interacts with FKBP rapamycin binding domain in presence
of rapamycin). Our results suggest that cytoskeleton interacting adaptor
proteins organize proteins on the membrane. We have also explored the role
of actomyosin machinery in the membrane organization of Drosophila
E-cadherin (DE-cadherin) complex. My results suggest that the
cytoskeleton interacting adaptor proteins are also required for the
organization of DE-cadherin protein on the membrane and potentiate
endocytosis.

III. <br> Chaperone assisted folding of the heterodimeric protein monellin </br><br>The cell cytoplasm has thousands of proteins being
simultaneously synthesized, making them prone to aggregation and
degradation. Hence, protein folding in a lot of cases in vivo is assisted
by chaperones, which ensures correct and timely formation of the natively
folded structures. The process of protein folding is complicated further
for proteins that are multimeric, because of the additional requirement of
chain complementation and shared folding codes in some cases.
Interestingly, majority of the GroEL substrates are multimeric proteins,
but very few studies have been done to look into the nature of assistance
provided by this chaperone system, especially in cases where chain
association is the first step of folding.
Double chain monellin (DcMn) is a small, sweet plant protein, whose
folding and unfolding pathways have been studied in great details in the
lab. It's a hetero-dimeric protein, consisting of chains A and B of
roughly similar molecular weights, associated non-covalently. It has been
shown for DcMn that completely unstructured chains associate to form an
encounter complex C, which then folds to the native state, utilizing
multiple pathways, with or without forming intermediates. Experiments with
single chain variant of monellin (ScMn) have shown that GroEL (the most
abundant E. coli chaperone) can modulate its folding energy landscape by
binding folding intermediates on parallel pathways in different ways and
with different affinities, and can also unfold late productive
intermediates through a thermodynamic coupling mechanism. The overall aim
of my project is to use DcMn to look at the ability of the GroEL-ES
chaperone system to assist in the folding of this heterodimeric protein,
and to try to delineate the process of chain association from that of
folding.
In this AWS, I?ll be discussing experiments that I?ve done to establish
that the individual unstructured chains of monellin bind to GroEL. These
experiments have been done by either exploiting the intrinsic fluorescence
properties of the chains or by introducing a fluorophore to study binding
with GroEL.
II. <br> Analysis of Phosphatidic acid (PA) signaling in Drosophila
phototransduction </br><br>In depth understanding of any signal transduction process
demands quantitation of the molecules involved in the signaling pathway.
In order to study signal transduction in such detail, we have chosen the
Drosophila phototransduction cycle as a model system. This cycle involves
a G-protein coupled phosphoinositide pathway, where hydrolysis of
phosphatidyl inositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) by phospholipase C
generates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and diacyl glycerol (DAG),
leading to activation of Ca2+-permeable light-sensitive channels. Previous
studies from the lab have shown that regulation of phosphatidic acid (PA)
levels is critical for photoreceptor structure and function. PA levels in
photoreceptors are regulated by multiple enzymes; however the importance
of PA generated by each of these in unknown. To understand this I have
studied the regulation of the diverse molecular species of PA modulated by
each of these enzymes using direct infusion mass spectrometry
(Shotgun-MS). Using this technique we are currently addressing two major
questions. (A) Is there any specificity of enzymatic product at molecular
level in the sensory transduction of Drosophila? (B) What is the role of
diverse molecular species of (PA), the key intermediate in signaling
cascade, in the phototransduction cycle? This will shed further light on
the signaling role of PA. <br> The role of CLIC/GEEC pathway as a regulator of cellular membrane
homeostasis </br><br>Clathrin independent endocytic (CIE) pathways are being
increasingly implicated in fundamental cellular processes. The CLIC/GEEC
(CG) pathway is clathrin and dynamin independent. This pathway
internalizes GPI-Anchored proteins(GPI-AP) and a significant fraction of
fluid phase. CG pathway has approprirate properties to make it a regulator
of cellular membrane dynamics: it is a high capacity pathway that can
internalize the equivalent of entire plasma membrane area in 12 minutes.
GEECs [GPI-AP Enriched Early Endosomal Compartments] can sort cargoes and
can rapidly regurgitate major fraction of fluid phase that is delivered to
it. GPI-AP containing recycling compartments have also been implicated in
providing membrane during cell spreading. Thus a high capacity pathway
like the CG pathway that can sort and rapidly regurgitate major fraction
of endocytic content could help in rapid membrane turnover. Rapid membrane
redistribution through this pathway could be important during processes
such as cell spreading, mitosis and cell migration.
I have looked at the dynamics of endocytic pathways in processes that need
rapid membrane change in the context of cell deadhering and spreading. I
have previously shown that there is increased fluid uptake on deadhering
while there is no change in Transferrin uptake. This indicates that CG
pathway but not a clathrin dependent(CD) pathway is involved in this
process. Recycling during cell spreading also showed a tight correlation
to fluid regurgitation but not to Tf recycling; inhibiting fluid
regurgitation blocked cell spreading. Now, I have used ligands, inhibitors
and mutant cell lines to look at the specificity of CG pathway in cell
detachment and spreading and will discuss my recent findings.

II. <br> An Objective Scoring Scheme to recognize near-native poses of
protein-protein interactions and search for DNA-binding proteins in
Arabidopsis thaliana </br><br>The precise interactions between nucleic acids and proteins
drive majority of the cellular processes. DNA binding proteins regulate
genetic activity such as transcription, DNA rearrangement, replication and
repair. Transcription factors (TF) specifically interact with DNA
sequence and either positively or negatively influence the transcription
of specific genes. They are also known to interact with each other and
form complexes, thus leading to combinatorial diversity to monitor gene(s)
expression. In order to study these physical interactions, molecular
docking can be employed to generate the TF-TF complex. However, docking
softwares typically propose number of poses and hence impinge a serious
challenge to identify the native (or near native) structures from the pool
of these solutions. We have devised a scoring scheme to recognize optimal
sites for protein-protein interactions. We propose a rigorous scoring
scheme called DockScore, which can be used to rank the docked poses and
extract the biologically meaningful pose.
I would also be discussing our attempts to collate and analyze the
DNA-binding protein families (DBome). Subsequently, we performed a
comprehensive survey of Arabidopsis thaliana genome for DNA-binding
proteins (At-DBome) in order to understand their distribution and the
associated functions. Our search protocol helped to assign DNA-binding
property to several proteins that were previously marked as unknown,
putative or hypothetical in function. <br> Integration of dopamine and adenosine signaling during development
of the nervous system -The role of DARPP-32 </br><br>Impaired motor behaviour is a result of imbalanced coordination
and integration of excitatory and inhibitory signals in the neuronal
network, with dopamine being the most important neuromodulator. This
project focusses on DARPP-32, a key integrator of dopaminergic signaling,
aiming to decipher its interaction with the dopamine and adenosine
receptor pathway and its role in motor behaviour. The dopamine and cyclic
adenosine 3'5' monophosphate regulated neuronal phosphoprotein DARPP-32,
which is mainly expressed in dopamine receptive neurons, acts by nhibiting
either protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) or protein kinase A (PKA), thereby
triggering opposing biochemical functions and modulating electrical
activity. However, the mechanism by which DARPP-32 affects neural
development and function is not known. To shed more light on this
fundamental question I will use zebrash as a model system in which I
perturb DARPP-32 using pharmacological assays and genetic tools. I will
first characterize the normal ontogeny of DARPP-32 expression using
quantitative realtime PCR and immunohistochemistry and subsequently
determine gene expression changes upon pharmacological perturbance. Next I
will alter normal DARPP-32 function using knock-down and overexpression
approaches and assay the electrical activity of neurons using whole cell
patch clamp. I will also look at the effects of these perturbations on
behaviour, using high speed videography.

III. <br> How to make a vesicle without a coat? </br><br>Eukaryotic cells employ multiple endocytic routes to
internalize cell surface receptors, nutrients, membrane proteins/lipids
and extracellular fluid. Although, Clathrin dependent endocytic pathway
are well studied, Clathrin independent endocytic pathways are emerging as
key players in many cellular processes. The pathway that we are
investigating is a Clathrin and Dynamin independent, CDC42 regulated
pathway which gives rise to Clathrin Independent carriers (CLIC)/GPI-AP
enriched endosomal compartments (GEEC). The CLIC/GEEC (CG) pathway is a
high capacity pathway that internalises many membrane components such as
Folate receptor, Thy-1, CD44 and majority of the fluid phase. While the
CG pathway is regulated by small GTPases and is sensitive to actin and
cholesterol, morphologically it appears to lack a coat.
 In the absence of any discernable coat and Dynamin, the central question
is how CG pathway forms its endocytic vesicles. Curvature generation is
central to any vesicle budding process and can be dynamically modified by
altering lipid composition, oligomerization of scaffolding proteins and
insertion of peripheral membrane proteins. BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs)
domain containing proteins have been shown to play a crucial role in
curvature generation and stabilisation. BAR domain family members differ
from each other based on their curvature preference and the accessory
domains. These
accessory domains may help in localisation of the BAR domain containing
protein to the site of vesicle formation via binding to lipids, influence
actin polymerisation around them, or recruit other proteins to the site
their formation.
Therefore, I am investigating BAR domain proteins for their role in the CG
pathway. Towards this, I am screening a number of BAR domain containing
proteins for their participation in CG endocytosis via RNAi startgey. I
will here discuss my results pertinent to the screen. In addition to this,
to understand the process of CG vesicle formation in further depth, I will
also investigate the lipid composition and nature of the actin machinery
involved in this process.
II. <br> Understanding the mechanism of action of phosphatidylinositol
transfer proteins (PITPs) in vivo </br><br>Phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PITPs) are proteins
capable of binding and transferring single molecule of
phosphatidylinositol (PI) between membranes in vitro. These are expressed
in all eukaryotes and have been identified as key players in numerous
signalling pathways relying on phosphatidylinositol (PI) turnover. Notably
they are required for receptor-stimulated turnover of phosphatidylinositol
(4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) by phospholipase C (PLC) , regulated exocytosis,
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity and for budding of 
secretory granules from the trans Golgi network. Several members of the
PITP family have now been
identified and are grouped using bioinformatics? criteria into two
distinct classes namely Class I and Class II PITPs. Class I PITPs are
soluble 32KDa proteins which have dual lipid binding specificity for PI
and PC. Class II PITPs are membrane associated 160KDa proteins whose
founding member is Drosophila RDGB. Despite of sequence heterogeneities,
members of the PITP family are interchangeable when tested for in vitro
lipid transfer ability or restoration of the PLC based signalling in cell
lines. Although we do have an understanding of the lipid binding
properties of these PITPs, we do not have any evidence for their function
and differential regulation in vivo.
I am trying to understand the mechanism of action of PITPs in vivo, using
Drosophila photoreceptors (PRs) as a model system. Drosophila PRs express
a Class II PITP namely RDGB. The rdgB mutants exhibit light induced
progressive retinal degeneration and have an abnormal response to light as
measured by external recordings from eye (ERG). I have been trying to
understand the role played by RDGB in the context of PLC mediated GPCR
signalling in PRs. In my previous work presentation I had demonstrated
that binding to PI is essential for the in vivo function of RDGB, however
it was not clear if PI binding alone was sufficient for all its functions.
I will be discussing results which demonstrate that PI binding is not the
sole determinant for its function in vivo. I will also be presenting some
preliminary results shedding light on the possible biochemical trigger for
the retinal degeneration in these mutants.
III. <br> Optically Probing for CA3-CA1 Connectivity in Hippocampus </br><br>New memories are formed in the brain in a structure known as
the hippocampus. In the hippocampus, encoding of memories is thought to be
accompanied by changes in the strength of connections between the CA3 and
CA1 neuronal networks. Looking at how these connections change during this
process is one way to study memory formation. Unfortunately, the study of
the individual connections (or synapses) between these neurons has been
difficult due to extremely sparse connectivity (~5%) between the neurons
of the above networks. In the past year, I have been trying to develop a
new technique to study individual connections in this network. The method
involves intracellular recording of the synaptic responses from the CA1
neuron while optically stimulating at a number of spots in the CA3 cell
layer to find potentially connected cells. The optical stimulation is
facilitated by the expression of blue light sensitive protein called
ChannelRhodopsin2 (Chr2) in the membranes of the CA3 neurons. These cells
fire action potential in response to blue light stimulus, which in this
case is delivered by integrating a DLP projector into the microscope light
path. In the forthcoming talk, I will discuss the progress made in
developing the above technique. <br> PI(4,5)P2 dynamics in *Drosophila melanogaster* phototransduction </br><br>The cell has very sophisticated ways of controlling its various
functions. There are many different types of functions which are
controlled by unique sets of interactions between numerous proteins,
lipids, sugars, small molecules etc. Phosphatidylinositol-4,
5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is one of the key signaling phospholipids which
involved in regulating many of the cell?s functions. Generally its
concentration on the cell membrane is around 30-50 ?M. Despite being such
a minor component, PIP2 controls functions like cell division, migration,
apoptosis, channel regulation etc. How the cell controls all these
functions through such a small amount of PIP2 is poorly understood. We
are trying to address this question with the help of *Drosophila
melanogaster* phototransduction where PIP2 plays an important role. We
are trying to build a mathematical model for the phospholipid dynamics of
*Drosophila* phototransduction and also looking at various feedback
mechanisms across compartments.
III. <br> Analysis of modifiers of Notch-mediated anti-apoptotic activity
in mammalian cells </br><br>Notch signalling is initiated by interactions with ligands that activate
sequential, proteolytic cleavage of the transmembrane receptor leading to
the release of the Notch intracellular domain (NIC). NIC localizes to the
nucleus and interacts with the CBF1 protein to initiate transcription,
thus regulating cell fate decisions during metazoan development. However,
work from the laboratory has ascribed anti-apopotic functions to NIC,
which require its localization in the cytoplasm and is compromised by
enforced nuclear sequestration. To explore diverse signalling cascades
activated by Notch1/NIC and the regulation of its anti-apoptotic function
in mammalian cells, we screened a subset of genes - using shRNA ? against
H(K)ATs and H(K)DACs to identify modifiers of NIC-mediated anti-apoptotic
activity. I will describe my work analyzing Sirtuin1 (Sirt1) regulation
of NIC activity in mammalian cells. Sirt1, a NAD+ dependent deacetylase
was recently reported to tune transcriptional outputs of Notch
signaling1,2. Using chemical perturbations and RNA interference
approaches, we now show that enzymatically active Sirt1 modulated
NIC-mediated anti-apoptotic activity, an output decoupled from nuclear
functions of the receptor. To investigate if NIC is a direct target of
Sirt1, we undertook sequential modification of lysine (K) residues and
report that an NIC recombinant with site-directed replacement of four
lysine residues to non-acetylable arginine (NIC4K&#61614;R) acquired
independence from regulation by Sirt1. Sirt1 regulated NIC-mediated
protection from diverse apoptotic stimuli including
deprivation-induced apoptosis in a fibroblast cell line. More recent
evidence showing that Sirt1 controls assembly of a membrane-proximal Notch
signaling complex in T-cells, suggests that this interaction may determine
sub-cellular localization of NIC1 and consequently life and death
decisions in T-cells.

consequences </br><br>Stress modulates neuronal structure and function in the amygdala. Acute
stress (single episode, immobilization for 2 h), proposed to be a model
of PTSD, leads to a delayed onset of both anxiety-like behaviour and an
increase in spine density in the amygdala. The social interaction test in
rats is an ethologically relevant behavior paradigm for evaluating social
anxiety which can be correlated with social complications associated with
human patients with PTSD. We tested if AIS induced anxiety can be probed
with the social interaction test. Collectively, our results suggest that
stressed rats show less social interaction when compared to controls.
My second set of experiments focused on the mechanisms of increased spine
density in amygdala following AIS. Dendritic spine changes are associated
with long-term synaptic plasticity, occurrence of which can be blocked by
antagonizing NMDA receptors. Therefore, infusion of NMDAR antagonist
(AP-5) in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) at the beginning of stress
restored the spine density to control levels, strongly suggesting the
involvement of NMDA transmission in stress induced spinogenesis.

II. <br> Understanding the Signalling Functions of PI4P in Drosophila
Phototransduction </br><br>Phosphoinositides are glycerophospholipid derivatives that have
been shown to function as second messengers in a variety of signalling
cascades. There are different sub-cellular pools of specific
phosphoinositides, each of which subserve distinct functions.
Phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) is one such lipid that has been
implicated in cellular processes, such as vesicular trafficking from the
trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane and the recruitment of adaptor
proteins, as seen in studies conducted on yeast and mammalian cells. It is
the major precursor for the synthesis of
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in the cell. I aim to
understand the role of PI4P as a signalling molecule using Drosophila
phototransduction as a model system. Drosophila phototransduction is a
GPCR-mediated signalling pathway, driven by the hydrolysis of
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) by the enzyme phospholipase C
(PLC). The synthesis and maintenance of PIP2 in the plasma membrane is a
multi-step process, of which PI4P is a key intermediate in that it is the
primary precursor of PIP2. PI4P itself is majorly synthesised by the
action of lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase (PI4K) on the lipid
phosphatidylinositol (PI).
In my initial experiments, I would like to see the effects of modulating
the levels of PI4P, one way to achieve which would be to <br> Sculpting circuits in the cerebellum: The role of gap junctions </br><br>Synapses in the brain are made according to a specific plan
that is gradually constructed as an animal develops from the embryo. What
the mechanisms are, that aid the construction of this vast neuronal
network still remains unanswered. One such cue could be the presence of
gap junctions which are direct cytoplasmic connections between cells. It
has been proposed that communication via these gap junctions are a
prerequisite for the formation of chemical synapses and maturation of
neuronal circuits. My objective is to test this hypothesis in the
zebrafish cerebellum. The cerebellum is essential for coordination of
movement and motor learning. It has an elaborate circuit with the Purkinje
Neuron (PN) forming the main integrative centre and the output neuron of
the cerebellar cortex. The experimental plan is to knock down gap
junctions early in development and to observe how it affects
electrophysiological properties of the PN. So far I have characterised the
electrophysiological properties of PNs in wild type fish using In vivo
Whole cell patch clamp recordings. PNs show spontaneous activity that
consists of simple spikes and bursts. They also show activity in the
absence of Sodium currents and these therefore may be mediated by Calcium.
In the absence of synaptic input, they show intrinsic spikes and also
respond to current injections but in different ways. They show both
excitatory and inhibitory miniature post synaptic currents. I will present
this preliminary data and my ongoing work in this presentation.
Understanding the role of gap junctions in circuit development will
provide insight into general principles that the developing brain uses to
assemble itself.
III. <br> Actin based nanoclustering of outer leaflet proteins: coupling
between the outer and inner leaflets of the plasma membrane </br><br>GPI anchored proteins (GPI-APs) constitute a significant
percentage (0.5%) of eukaryotic membrane proteins. The GPI anchor helps
these proteins attach the membrane and associate with specific cholesterol
and sphingolipid enriched microdomains. These microdomains serve as
platforms for the organizing cytoplasmic signaling molecules and the
membrane environment for a variety of signaling proteins. Work from our
laboratory has shown that the underlying actin cytoskeleton helps in the
organization of GPI-APs into nanoclusters (1,2). A central question is the
identity of the linker which connects the outer leaflet proteins to the
actin cytoskeleton at the inner leaflet. To address this issue I have
looked at some of the inner leaflet lipids which may facilitate this
transbilayer coupling. My results suggest that Phosphatidylserine (PS), an
inner leaflet lipid (3) is a key player in linking GPI-APs with the actin
cytoskeleton. In addition, the length of the acyl chain of the GPI-AP and
PS is an important factor in engaging this transbilayer coupling
mechanism. I also discuss attempts to explore the linker which connects PS
to the actin cytoskeleton. This would help in understanding the nature of
this transbilayer coupling mechanism in greater detail.

III. <br> Studying the regulation of Phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate
levels in vivo </br><br>Phosphatidylinositol is a glycerophospholipid that can be
phosphorylated at position 3, 4, or 5 of the inositol ring, to generate a
set of molecules with multiple activity in biological systems.
Phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate(PI5P) is one of these whose function in
cells remains unclear. The enzymatic routes by which PI5P is metabolized
in cells is controversial. Recently it has been shown that
phosphatidylinositol 5 phosphate 4 kinase mutants in Drosophila show
elevated levels of PI5P and reductions in cell size (Gupta et al., 2013).
Using this model system we are investigating the mechanisms by which PI5P
may be generated in vivo and its role in the regulation of cell size.
As a part of the initial work, I will discuss some of the results we found
on perturbing some of the enzymes that are implicated in the synthesis of
PI5P.

ProcNatlAcadSci U S A.5963-8. <br> Characterization of I ? switch to different cellular organelles </br><br>A eukaryotic cell function is tied to regulated uptake and
secretion of different bio-molecules. This is orchestrated by various
functional fusion events between different intracellular compartments:
Plasma Membrane, Early and Late Endosomes, Golgi Network, Endoplasmic
Reticulum (ER), Lysosomes to name a few. These compartments are
functionally connected to each other via a series of controlled fusion
events between their membranes. One of the crucial determinants of this
functional networking is the acidity of the lumen of these compartments
which is maintained by proton concentration, concentrations of different
counter ions (Cl-, HCO3-, K+, Na+, Ca2+), membrane ion permeabilities and
various ATP-dependent proton pumps. Maintenance of intracellular pH
homeostasis is essential for protein glycosylation, protein sorting,
biogenesis of secretory granules and transport along both biosynthetic and
endocytic pathways.
Keeping in mind the physiological pH ranges, there is a need to devise and
characterize a repertoire of I-switches which can function at different pH
range and thus, can report on the pH dynamics of the concerned
organelle/pathway.
To tune the functional pH range of I-switch we have changed the sequence
of i-motif forming sequences by increasing the length of ?C? stretch from
three cytosines (I3) to seven cytosines (I7). With increasing number of
cytosines we see a shift in the functional pH regime of the I-switch
towards more basic pH. Cytosines get hemiprotonated (C+-H-C basepairing)
which drives the formation of I-motif. pKa of Cytosine N3 is ~4.5, thus,
conventional DNA4 I-motifs have maximum stability at pH 5.5. Thus it
should be possible to tune the pH response of I-switch towards a more
acidic or basic pH regime by changing the pKa of the constituent
cytosines. Thus could be done by introducing by specific chemical
modifications to cytosine which changes pKa of cytosines to more acidic
region (5-bromo-cytosine, pKa~ 2.45) or to the alkaline regime
(5-methyl-cytosine, pKa~9.1) respectively, should drive the formation of
i-motif to either more acidic or basic pH.
II. <br> I-Switch in C. elegans: Accessing retrogradely
 moving neuronal compartments </br><br>Neurons are characterized by their unique morphology and
efficient sorting and transport of cargo over long distances. However,
even basic mechanisms and cues regulating this transport, particularly
from the synapse to the cell body, are unknown. This dearth of information
is predominantly due to a lack of tools to access these retrogradely
moving cargo-carrying vesicles. My project is aimed at developing such a
DNA based tool that combines ease of accessibility of compartments with
molecular programming, while providing in vivo read-outs of functional
cues of transport at the same time. One of the prerequisites for this
targeting to neuronal vesicles is an adaptor protein that can bind a DNA
nanostructure and act as an interface between the DNA scaffold and the
vesicular cargo. Such an adaptor protein would ensure generality of the
targeting principle to different compartments and neuronal populations in
a ligand-free manner. Currently, I am trying to screen for and express a
synthetic DNA binding protein from an antibody based library. This screen,
which utilizes a phage display approach, has led to several candidate hits
that can be taken forward for expression and targeting of DNA
architectures in C. elegans neurons.

II. <br> Phylogenetic effects on visual temporal sensitivity in
Lepidopteraninsects </br><br>Compound eyes execute a wide range of functions in both diurnal
and nocturnal insects. To operate over a range of light intensities,
insect eyes have undergone both structural and physiological adaptations.
For example, photoreceptors of diurnal insects are temporally better
resolved than their nocturnal counterparts. Previous studies have focused
on phylogenetically distant insects which are physiologically and
ecologically distinct, with very diverse requirements for motion sensing.
For instance, the temporal sensitivity curves of visual interneurons of
hovering moths are very different as compared to moths that tend to fly
fast. Can such selectivity occur at earlier stages of motion processing?
Also, is such selectivity dependent on lifestyles of extant insects, or
are they phylogenetically constrained? We addressed these questions by
performing a comparative study of visual temporal resolution in the insect
order Lepidoptera using electroretinography and using flicker fusion
frequency (FFF) as a measure for temporal senstivity.The wide variety of
structural adaptations in Lepidopteran eyes, as well as their diverse
temporal niches, makes them ideal subjects for such a comparative study.
On a broad scale, we observed that predominantly diurnal Lepidopteran
families showed a trend toward higher FFF values. However, we also
observed significant effects of phylogenetic relationships on the FFF.
Moths generally exhibited relatively low FFF values (100-150 Hz), while
basal butterfly families exhibited a combinationof lower and higher FFFs.
The most derived butterfly families, the Nymphalidae and Pieridae, showed
only high FFF values (170-220 Hz). Diurnal moths and crepuscular
butterflies also showed evidence of phylogenetic constraints; their FFFs
did not differ from their relatives. Our study suggests thatcombining
phylogenetic and functional considerations is important when studying
adaptations of sensory systems. <br> Identifying transcriptional targets of IP3 mediated Calcium
signaling and Store Operated Calcium Entry in Drosophila neurons. </br><br>Inositol (1,4,5) Trisphosphate (IP3) is a second messenger that
mediates the release of intracellular calcium via the IP3 Receptor (IP3R).
 The IP3R is known to plays an important role in controlling a variety of
Ca2+-dependent cellular functions. Mutations in the only gene for the IP3R
in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster result in flight defects [1].
Similar flight deficits are observed by knocking down IP3R or STIM, the
calcium sensor on the ER, specifically in the nervous system indicating a
neuronal requirement of intracellular calcium signaling for flight. The
expression of IP3R and STIM is essential during initial stages of pupal
development for adult flight indicating a developmental role [2]. Although
it is now well established that IP3R and STIM function is required for
flight circuit development in pupae, the cellular or molecular events by
which the phenotype is manifested remain to be understood. A likely
hypothesis is that dynamic changes in intracellular Ca2+ levels, either
through IP3R or store operated calcium entry (SOCE) or both, alter the
frequency of Ca2+ spikes and thus duration of global Ca2+ transients in
flight circuit neurons thus affecting gene transcription, as seen in
non-excitable mammalian cells [3]. We wish to identify transcriptional
changes that succeed IP3R and SOCE mediated cytosolic calcium surges in
excitable cells using this system. To address this question I have
measured the transcriptional profile of the pupal central nervous systems
of control and STIM knockdown animals by next generation RNA sequencing to
identify immediate early and early genes responsive to SOCE. Read assembly
using Cufflinks and differential expression analysis with Cuffdiff lead to
the identification of a number of targets which are currently being
validated by quantitative real time PCR and functional studies.

III. <br> To study the role of FMRP associated miRNAs in neuronal
Differentiation </br><br>Fragile X is a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder caused by
CGG repeat expansion in the Fmr1 gene which results in its silencing.
Fragile X mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) is a specific RNA binding
protein which regulates protein translation of target mRNAs at the
synapse. FMRP in its phosphorylated form is able to recruit RNA induced
silencing complex (RISC) on the mRNA which results in translation
repression. Activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) results
in dephosphorylation of FMRP, which causes RISC-mRNA dissociation and
translation of the target mRNA. The role of FMRP in regulating synaptic
plasticity and local protein translation is well studied but much less is
known about its role in neuronal development. Recent studies have shown
altered differentiation of stem cells in terms of neuron/glia ratios in
absence of FMRP. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as key regulators of cell
fate decisions, since FMRP associates with miRNA its absence may alter
miRNA regulation and therefore cell fate decision .since there is no data
available on miRNA associated with FMRP, my project is aimed to identify
the miRNAs associated with FMRP in different stages of neuronal
development. I would also study the effect of FMRP expression/knock down
in Human embryonic stem cells in context of cell fate determination and
probe into molecular mechanisms which are involved in this process

III. <br> Understanding the role of GPI anchor in the plasma membrane
organization of GPI anchored Proteins (GPI-APs). </br><br>Glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored proteins (GPI-AP) are
glycolipid tethered proteins on the cell surface which are implicated in
important functions such as signal transduction, immune response, cancer
cell invasion, metastasis and pathophysiology of parasites. Although it
seems that the obvious function of the GPI moiety in GPI-AP is to anchor
the protein to the plasma membrane, several lines of evidence suggest an
important role for the ?GPI anchor? in the organization of GPI anchored
proteins (GPI-AP) at the plasma membrane. Previous studies from our and
other laboratories have shown that GPI-APs are organized into nanoscale
clusters at the plasma membrane. This organization was found to be
dependent on the membrane lipid composition, specifically cholesterol, and
the underlying cortical actin activity. However the mechanism by which the
GPI-AP, residing in the outer leaflet, cross-talks with the actin
cytoskeleton proximal to the bilayer is poorly understood. We propose a
trans-bilayer coupling mechanism wherein a putative inner leaflet lipid,
capable of direct or indirect interaction with actin, interlinks actin
beneath the bilayer to the GPI-APs in the outer leaflet via lipid tail
interactions. In order to test this hypothesis, we used two classes of
synthetic fluorescent GPI analogues containing variations in either the 1)
lipid tail length or 2) lipid saturation, and incorporated them into the
plasma membrane of CHO cells to study the effect on membrane organization
by Homo-FRET based anisotropy measurements. The results obtained from
these experiments will be discussed during the seminar.
II. <br> The role of Oct4 in modulating apoptotic responses and
heterogeneity in cervical cancer </br><br>Chemoresistance and radioresistance pose serious problems in
the prognosis of Cervical cancer. Heterogeneity has been implicated in the
emergence of such enduring cell populations (Baumann et al; 2005. Dean et
al; 2008). Previous work from the lab, looking into the heterogeneous
nature of cervical cancer has characterized a subpopulation of cells that
are Notch High with CD66 surface expression. Further functional
verification of this subset has led to the understanding that they are
more tumourigenic, metastatic and stem like. An invitro system, the
sphere culture using CaSki cell line, a metastatic lesion derived cervical
cancer cell line, better recapitulates the heterogeneity seen in primary
tumors than monolayer cultures has been standardized in the lab (Bajaj et
al; 2011). The sphere can be likened to a heterogeneous niche with
different gradients of stresses across it defining and specifying the cell
types that can be sustained by each. In this context prosurvival
mechanisms and the molecules involved in mediating them become important
and understanding them provide a window for possible therapeutic
intervention. Additionally these molecules could also be involved in the
stem like nature of resultant cells. I am testing Oct4 as a candidate in
mediating prosurvival in the CD66 subset. Oct4 has been implicated in
prosurvival in cervical cancer(Wang et al; 2013). It is shown to be
regulated under different stresses(Forristal et al; 2012,Mengfei Chen et
al; 2012). I am trying to investigate the role of Oct4 as a modulator of
apoptotic response in the emergent subsets of cells in cervical cancer and
the molecular mechanisms that mediate the same. <br> Neural organisation of antennal mechanosensors in Oleander hawk
moth (Daphnis nerii, Lepidoptera) </br><br>Most flying insects position their antenna before flight
initiation and this position is maintained during flight. A set of
mechanosensors, the B?hm?s bristles situated in the two basal segments of
the antennae are involved in setting and maintaining antennal position.
The axonal arbors of the B?hm?s bristles overlap with the dendritic arbors
of the antennal motor neurons. Another set of antennal proprioceptors, the
Johnston?s organs, are involved in flight control and located
circumferentially around the pedicel ? flagellum joint of the antenna. The
sensory arbors of both B?hm?s bristles and Johnston?s organs arborize in a
region of the brain called the Antennal Motor and Mechanosensory Centre
(AMMC). Our study aims to use neuranatomical methods to understand the
organization of the two sets of mechanosensors relative to the antennal
motor system, and understand its functional implications. Fluorescent dye
fills of these neurons indicate that axons of individual B?hm?s bristle
fields overlap in the ipsilateral AMMC. Johnston?s organs axonal arbors
show a similar overlap pattern. However, the axonal arbors of B?hm?s
bristles and Johnston?s organs do not show much spatial overlap within the
AMMC. B?hm?s bristle axonal arbors from all bristle fields overlap with
dendritic arbors of all antennal motor neurons unlike axonal arbors of
Johnston?s organs. Based on these preliminary results, we suggest that
B?hm?s bristles serve to position the antenna thus enabling Johnston?s
organs to operate within their working range. Further, AMMC might have sub
regions which provide different mechanosensory feedback to the antenna.
Using the comparative approach, we are also conducting a survey to
understand if this organization is broadly conserved in all flying
insects. <br> MutS2 and UvrABC: Molecular determinants of genomic integrity </br><br>Homologous recombination (HR) is responsible for the
integration of exogenous DNA and rearrangements in the genome. It should
be regulated so that genomic rearrangements do not occur at a frequency
that can compromise genetic viability. MutS2, in H. pylori, suppresses HR
and thus, probably serves to optimally calibrate the frequency of genomic
rearrangements. I aim to unearth the mechanism utilized by this protein to
inhibit recombination. Nucleotide Excision Repair is an important DNA
repair pathway that is highly conserved in both prokaryotes and
eukaryotes. NER is capable of recognizing and removing a large number of
chemically and structurally different DNA lesions that destabilize the DNA
helix. The proteins UvrA, UvrB and UvrC represent specific components of
this pathway. Their co-ordinated action results in detection of damaged
nucleotides and excision of a stretch of single stranded DNA flanking the
damaged nucleotide. Using the NER pathway in Mycobacterium tuberculosis as
a model system, I aim to understand the structural basis of damage
recognition and strand discrimination during NER. In this AWS, I will tell
about the progress made so far. <br> Identification of novel inhibitors of the TLR-4 signaling pathway </br><br>The TLR-4 signaling pathway is a critical component of the
innate immune system. It recognises pathogen-associated molecular patterns
and upon activation by ligand binding, results in the production of
proinflammatory cytokines which act as a mechanism to alert other cells of
the immune system. As long as the production of proinflammatorycytokines
is within limits, it remains as a protector. However, in the event of an
uncontrolled response, these very protectors can do more harm than good,
damaging the body?s own organs leading to various diseases such as
autoimmunity and the life-threatening condition of sepsis. The current few
drugs designed for counteracting these diseases are mostly targeted
towards the extracellular domain of TLR-4 while a few of them are
peptidomimics of the intracellular domain. In order to identify novel
drugs which could inhibit the signalling pathway, we focused on one
adaptor protein, TRAM, which is essential for relaying the signal from the
TLR-4 receptor to the downstream effector proteins. Through a combination
of homology modelling, docking and virtual screening techniques, we have
predicted compounds which could act as potential inhibitors of the TLR-4
signaling pathway. These compounds need to be validated for their
inhibitory activity by experimental means. <br> Design of Remodeling Actomyosin Networks in vitro - A Step
 Towards a Minimal Actin Cortex System </br><br>The aim of our work is to understand the mechanisms behind
dynamic organization of the cellular plasma membrane, especially local
heterogeneities such as nanometer sized lipid domains (Mayor and Rao,
2004). As reported previously, glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored
protein (GPI-AP) organization in nano-clusters in the plasma membrane is
driven by the activity of cortical actin (Goswami et al., 2008). A recent
theoretical framework proposed by Gowrishankar et al. (2012) suggests that
the engagement of short actin filaments together with myosin-motor like
activity at the cytoplasmic leaflet is sufficient to explain all the
unusual features of GPI-AP organization.
Here, we present a strategy to reconstitute cortical actin dynamics in
vitro on supported lipid bilayers. This allows us to explore the role of
proteins thought to be involved in actin cluster formation and to test
predictions of the theoretical model. In a first step, we investigate how
the diffusion of membrane bound actin binding proteins is affected by
actin filaments of varying lengths. Then, we increase the complexity of
the system by including myosin II motors and capping proteins, and
identify conditions under which actin remodeling, i.e. transient formation
of actin asters, occurs. As suggested by observation in cells and by the
theoretical framework, short actin filaments (< 1 &#956;m) are the main
source of fast remodeling events whereas longer filaments create a more
static meshwork, which can confine membrane bound particles. In summary,
we introduce a new kind of minimal actin cortex, and show how dynamic
short actin can drive the organization of plasma membrane particles.

II. <br> Plant-fungus partnerships: the effect of consumers and resource
 access </br><br>Most land plants invest carbon in fungal mutualists like
arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and endophytic fungi. Mycorrhizae colonize
roots and improve soil resource access; endophytic fungi colonize shoots
and putatively help in herbivory defense. Plant investment in these fungal
mutualists can be driven by the tradeoff between herbivory defense and
resource access. Global change factors such as changes in precipitation
and temperature, and nitrogen and phosphorous deposition can also act on
these fungal mutualists by altering plant resource availability.
Mutualists like mycorrhizae and endophytes are likely to make the most
difference to plants growing in resource limited grazed ecosystems.
Further, in a system where the water availability limits how much carbon
plants can fix, plant decisions on investment into resource access versus
defense would be critical. In this AWS, I will discuss field experiments
conducted in the arid rangelands of the Trans-Himalayas to answer two
questions: 1. How does long-term herbivory affect plant - fungal mutualist
relationships? 2. How do the top-down and bottom-up forces of plant tissue
loss and water availability influence mycorrhizal densities in plants? I
will also be discussing future work aimed at understanding the impact of
some global change factors on the performance of fungal mutualists.
III. <br> Intracellular calcium signaling and CAMKII function in Drosophila
 flight </br><br>Calcium is synonymous with a wide variety of cellular
processes such as gene transcription, signal transduction, neural
excitability etc., which could all potentially impact animal behaviour.
Two key molecules of interest in intracellular Ca2+ signalling are the
endoplasmic reticulum resident Ca2+ channel, inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate
receptor (IP3R) and the ER calcium store depletion sensor, namely,
stromal-interacting molecule (STIM). A number of extracellular stimuli can
activate IP3R leading to the rapid release of Ca2+ from the ER stores.
Subsequently, store depletion is sensed by STIM which, with the help of
plasma membrane channel, ORAI and ER resident Ca2+ ATPase channels helps
replenish the stores - a process known as store-operated calcium entry
(SOCE). In Drosophila, mutants of IP3R show wing posture and flight
defects. These phenotypes are recapitulated upon pan neuronal down
regulation of IP3R or STIM, demonstrating a neuronal requirement of these
genes. More specifically, work is the lab has shown that SOCE in
dopaminergic neurons is required for proper flight circuit function and
development.
My project aims to understand the molecular basis of SOCE mediated flight
in dopaminergic neurons. In this annual work seminar, I shall present my
preliminary findings that suggest CAMKII to be a putative candidate that
signals downstream of SOCE in dopaminergic neurons. <br> Lipid body-associated retinyl ester fluorescence is associated with
pluripotency in Human ESCs and mouse epiblast stemcells. </br><br>We describe a characteristic blue fluorescence associated with
pluripotency in human embryonic stem cells, human induced pluripotent stem
cells and mouse epiblast stem cells. The blue fluorescence emission
(450-500 nm) is readily observed by fluorescence microscopy and
correlates with the expression of pluripotency markers (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG).
 It allows easy identification and isolation of undifferentiated human
pluripotent stem cells and high throughput sorting and propagation. The
fluorescence also appears early during somatic reprogramming. We now show
that the blue fluorescence arises from the sequestration of retinyl esters
in cytoplasmic lipid bodies. The retinoid-sequestering lipid bodies are
specific to human and mouse pluripotent stem cells of the ?primed? or
?epiblast-like? state and absent in ?na?ve? mouse ES cells. Retinol,
present in widely-used stem cell culture media, is taken up and sequestered
as retinyl ester specifically by ?primed? pluripotent cells and can induce
the formation of these lipid bodies. <br> Role of Voltage dependent Anion Channel-Hexokinase interaction in
Programmed cell death </br><br>The Voltage Dependent Anion-Selective Channel (VDAC) is the most
abundant protein of the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), plays a major
role in solute and metabolite (such as NAD+/NADH, ADP/ATP, succinate,
citrate, and ions like Ca2+) transport between cytosol and mitochondria
and also it has been shown that the VDAC is involved in the release of
apoptogenic proteins like cyt c via OMM. VDAC also forms a complex
pathological channel known as mitochondrial permeability transition pore
(mPTP) which is thought to be a complex of adenine nucleotide transporter
(ANT) of inner membrane, VDAC of outer membrane. VDACs from different
sources show varied primary sequence but conserved functional properties.
It has been observed that overexpression of VDAC induces cell death and
Hexokinase prevents cell death induced by overexpressed VDAC. The
mechanism by which Hexokinase prevents cell death is not fully understood.
In this AWS, I shall be going to present that how hexokinase helps in the
protection of cell death induced by VDAC overexpression.
II. <br> Understanding Biochemical and Biophysical Implications of &#945;
Tropomyosin Mutations in Inherited Cardiomyopathies </br><br>Cardiomyopathy is a disease of heart muscle and is one of the
leading causes of sudden cardiac death. Familial primary cardiomyopathy
affects 1 in 500 people and is inherited in an autosomal-dominant pattern.
To date, more than 400 mutations in 13 sarcomeric genes have been
associated with primary cardiomyopathies. The most common mutations are in
the genes encoding sarcomeric proteins. Thirty-one single-amino-acid
substitutions have been identified in the alpha-tropomyosin(Tm) gene TPM1.
These substitutions lie along the entire length of the protein and have
been associated with either hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathies
(HCM/DCM). However, the underlying molecular mechanism/s is ambiguous. To
understand the structural and functional changes that contribute to
disease, we have started studies on five HCM Tm mutants (E62Q, V95A,
I172T, L185R, S215L and M281T), one DCM (D230N) and one nemaline myopathy
mutant (E181K). I have started with biochemical assays to check for any
functional differences caused by the HCM mutations E62Q and V95A. The
initial step was to assay tropomyosin binding to actin in vitro, using
purified recombinant Ala-Ser-Tm and F-actin purified from chicken
pectoralis muscle. This provides the dissociation constant and
cooperativity of Tm binding to actin. Our reconstitution assays with E62Q
suggest that this substitution does not alter the actin binding affinity;
myosin ATPase activity nor the calcium sensitivity when compared with the
wild type. <br> A) Structural basis of target site recognition by Hes1.
 B) To unearth the structural basis of DNA binding by H-NS. </br><br>Hes1 protein belongs to basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
super-family of transcription factors and is an important downstream
effector of NOTCH signalling. Hes1 contains three functional domains- bHLH
domain, orange domain and C-terminal region. The bHLH domain of Hes1 binds
quasi-palindromic sequences called N- and E- boxes with high specificity.
The orange domain is predicted to enhance specificity and affinity of Hes1
towards target DNA.? Hes1 regulates transcription primarily by binding to
N and E boxes located in the promoter regions of target genes. I aim to
unearth the structural basis of target site recognition by Hes1. The
histone-like nucleoid structuring (H-NS) protein from Escherichia coli is
involved in compaction of the bacterial chromosome and in transcriptional
regulation. It binds to AT-rich regions in the bacterial chromosome. I
aims to study the interaction between H-NS and DNA to understand how it
achieves chromosomal compaction and transcription regulation.
The progress made in these two projects will be presented.
III. <br> Islands within islands: connectivity between anthropogenic
fragments resembles that between natural patches in a Western Ghats sky
island bird </br><br>Gene flow between populations could have been affected in
historic time by natural processes or more recently by anthropogenic
effects. Examining effects of anthropogenic habitat fragmentation in
species that live in habitats with natural patchiness have rarely been
conducted. Habitat fragmentation is known to affect species in various
ways, from limiting gene flow to potentially driving extinction. Species
living on mountain tops or sky islands inhabit naturally patchy habitats.
We proposed to examine how anthropogenic fragmentation affects species
that exist in such naturally patchy habitats. The sky islands of the
Western Ghats, a continuous chain of mountains that are further fragmented
due to large scale anthropogenic impacts provides us an opportunity to
examine historic and contemporary gene flow across natural and
anthropogenic patchiness simultaneously. We captured 218 individuals and
collected blood samples of two endemic, threatened birds sampling its
entire distribution. We detected major genetic structuring by deep
geographical barriers consistent with previous studies. We also detected
strong effects of historic genetic differentiation across natural patches
but not across anthropogenic fragments. We detected higher contemporary
differentiation relative to historic differentiation in anthropogenic
fragments compared to natural patches. Additionally, both historic and
contemporary differentiation scaled with geographical distance across
natural patches, indicating a classic island effect, but no such effect
was seen across anthropogenic fragments. We suggest that anthropogenic
fragmentation affects population connectivity in this landscape in
addition to natural patchiness. Despite this, several genetic diversity
parameters did not indicate deleterious genetic effects in these
populations, perhaps due to high population size and low levels of
movement through remnant forests. This first genetic connectivity study
across its entire distribution from this landscape, reveals that
sub-populations of these range-restricted species are highly disconnected
with effects of anthropogenic fragmentation resembling that of natural
islands.
II. <br> Why is an IP3 receptor mutant sensitive to nutritional stress? </br><br>Multicellular organisms continuously coordinate their growth,
development and behaviour with nutritional availability. While our
understanding of molecular pathways that control growth are well
understood in cells, how these signaling pathways integrate across organ
systems and therefore, have organism-level effects is still being
elucidated. Our lab has generated Drosophila mutants for the IP3 receptor,
a key effector of the Store-Operated Calcium Entry (SOCE) signaling
pathway. SOCE driven cytosolic calcium influx is known to function in
diverse cellular contexts like neurotransmission, fertilization etc.
Previous work from our lab has demonstrated that, as adults, the IP3
receptor mutants are obese, have increased starvation resistance and
hyperphagic; cumulatively, these suggest that the mutant is metabolically
dysfunctional. The mutant therefore offers an opportunity to understand
why and how IP3 mediated SOCE modulates organism-level responses to
nutritional stress. My work has evolved to focus on two aspects within
this framework: 1) Is compromised SOCE in neuropeptide-producing cells
responsible for the observed behavioral and metabolic phenotypes in the
mutant? I screened neuropeptides implicated in Drosophila feeding and
metabolism, and preliminary results suggest that short neuropeptide F
(sNPF) producing-cells required functional IP3 receptor to respond to
nutritional stress during Drosophila larval stage. 2) Why is the IP3
receptor mutant larvae sensitive to nutrition even at late larval stages,
when Drosophila larvae typically are not? There are two major signaling
pathways, the insulin/PI3K/Akt and TOR/S6K that are known to play a role
in integrating nutritional information with growth. Survivorship of the
mutant, upon starvation, can be genetically rescued by over-expressing
S6K, but not over-expressing drosophila insulin-like peptides. These raise
an intriguing possibility that SOCE can modulate the TOR/S6K pathway; a
hitherto unknown input into this growth regulatory pathway.
II <br> Why do some bacteria not wobble? </br><br><p>Bacterial genomes show large variation in genome organisation and composition, including traits such as tRNA content and codon use that determine translation efficiency. How has the process of translation evolved to deal with this variation? The known tRNA repertoire in all bacteria is sufficient to decode only up to 56 of the 61 sense codons. This discrepancy is solved by enzymes that modify anticodon bases of tRNAs and expand their decoding ability through wobble base pairing. Thus, tRNA modifying enzymes (MEs) could compensate for the absence of several tRNA molecules. Determining the evolutionary history of MEs in bacteria will provide insights into whether the tRNA gene content of bacteria is shaped by the evolution of MEs or vice versa.<br />We mined 1093 bacterial genomes for all known anticodon MEs and reconstructed the history of enzyme gain and loss on the bacterial phylogeny. We found that most MEs were ancestral to the eubacterial clade, and that ME evolution is dominated by multiple independent losses and gains of major ME pathways. In each case, we observed that the loss of the pathway was associated with the retention of unmodifiable tRNAs. In addition, ME loss was often associated with shifts in genome GC content and codon use. Thus, MEs evolved early in the eubacterial lineage and were lost repeatedly in conjunction with major shifts in genome GC and tRNA content. These results suggest that changes in genome GC content may have allowed diversification of the genetic code via ME evolution across eubacterial lineages.</p> <br> Site-specific stabilization of prion protein prevents its
oligomerization </br><br>Prion is a GPI-anchored protein present ubiquitously in the
brain cells of mammals. The autocatalytic conversion of the cellular prion
protein, PrPC, into the misfolded and aggregated form, PrPSc, is linked to
several fatal neurodegenerative diseases.Several lines of evidence
indicate that soluble oligomers rather than the amyloid fibrils are the
neurotoxic species. But the mechanism of formation of these oligomers,
especially the early structural changes, is poorly understood. The
structure of PrPC is known from NMR studies to consist of an unstructured
N-terminal domain and a structured C-terminal domain comprising 3
alpha-helices and 2 short beta strands. Recently, we have shown that
conversion of monomeric prion into aggregated form begins in the
C-terminal region comprising of alpha-helices 2 and 3, where helices 2 and
3 are converted into beta-sheet. Interestingly, alpha-helix 2 has a
stretch of amino acids (in its C-terminus) which has high propensity for
beta-sheet. In this AWS, I?ll show how specific stabilization of helix 2
of prion proteinhas stabilized the whole protein. More importantly, I?ll
show that thisstabilization of prion protein prevents its oligomerization
and there is an inverse relationship between prion stability and its
oligomerization. Hence, the C-terminus of alpha-helix 2 of prion could be
a potential target for therapeutics.
III <br> Genes underlying development of wing color-patterns in a mimetic
butterfly Papilio polytes. </br><br>Butterflies are one of the most studied and beautiful insect
taxa. They show variety of wing colors and patterns. The wing color
patterns are not only beautiful but they are also useful for butterfly
species. Some butterflies have camouflaging wing color patterns which help
butterflies to hide in their habitat; others have big spots which scare
away the predators. A butterfly species can also have the same color
pattern to that of another species, a phenomenon called as visual mimicry.
In some cases of visual mimicry, which are classified as Mullerian
mimicry, both the species are toxic to the predators and hence protected
by predation. Other cases, where only one species is toxic and other is
not, are classified as Batesian mimicry. Nevertheless, in both the cases,
mimicry provides protection from predators and thus, is a wonderful
example of adaptive evolution.
To understand evolution of visual mimicry in butterflies, one approach is
to understand the molecular processes which give rise to wing color
patterns and to know the genetic control of wing patterns in different
mimetic species. To answer these broad questions, at present our lab is
working on a butterfly species Papilio polytes.
In my first AWS, I will briefly introduce you to the butterfly wing
patterns, what do we know about them in general and in Papilio polytes.
Then I will talk about my proposed approach and some preliminary work I
have done to elucidate the molecular mechanisms which give rise to wing
color patterns in a mimetic butterfly Papilio polytes. <br> DNA Mismatch repair in prokaryotes: Beyond the E.coli paradigm </br><br>The Mismatch Repair (MMR) Pathway serves to maintain genomic
integrity by correcting errors that appear during replication. In E. coli,
the specific components of MMR are MutS, MutL and MutH. The co-ordinated
activity of these three proteins is required to identify the daughter
strand in duplex DNA and create a nick on this newly synthesized strand to
initiate the repair reaction. Computational analysis of genomes has shown
that many bacteria (such as Neisseria gonorrohoeae) do not possess any
homolog of MutH. It is therefore expected that the strategy followed for
strand discrimination and creation of a nick in the daughter strand to
initiate MMR will be different in these organisms. Using the pathway from
Neisseria gonorrhoeae as a model system, I aim to elucidate the mechanism
of MMR in organisms that do not follow the E. coli paradigm. The overall
strategy towards this end includes determining structures of the
components of MMR in their apo- and functional states. I have recently
determined the structure the MutS homolog from Neisseria gonorrhoeae
(named NgoS)- in its apo- state (2.65 ?) that gives a clue towards the
assembly of a functional MutS-DNA complex. <br> Sensory Representation of Multimodal Stimuli in the Mouse Hippocampus </br><br>The mammalian hippocampus is considered important in the
formation of new memories about experienced events (episodic or
autobiographical memory), general declarative memory (memories that can be
explicitly verbalized), spatial memory and navigation, and associations
between stimuli that are distinct in time, among other functions. To
achieve this, the Hippocampus must integrate information from different
sensory areas of the cortex.
My project deals with studying the spatio-temporal dynamics of
stimulus-evoked representations in the Hippocampal CA1 neurons. I monitor
calcium activity from a large number of CA1 neurons (>100) by Two-Photon
Imaging, with cellular resolution. My experiments also plan on controlling
the behavioural state of the animals, a factor known to affect the
activity of these cells.
In this presentation, I shall discuss my progress with three arms of the
project.
1. Designing a training paradigm to control the behaviour state of the
animals. Here, I train water-deprived mice to respond to a tone with a
lick. Reinforcement is through a water reward.
2. Standardizing a chronic preparation to measure the activity of the
same cells over many days. Here, I have been able to get GCaMP, a
genetically encoded calcium indicator, to express in the CA1 cells.
3. Acute measurements with na?ve animals exposed to stimuli (tone and
whisker-puff. These will provide important control datasets for when I
couple behavioural training with imaging measurements.
Studying stimulus representation could provide a basic framework to
understanding the mechanisms followed when hippocampus dependent
associations are made. <br> Holocene paleoecology of the Banni Grassland, Kachchh, Gujarat ? A
multi proxy approach </br><br>Paleoecology, the study of deep time ecological history from
sedimentary records, serves as a potential tool to understand patterns,
causes, rates and directions of ecological changes due to climatic
variability and anthropogenic activities at various temporal scales. This
study aims to assess the Holocene paleoecology of the Banni Grassland in
North-western India. The Banni landscape in Gujarat is one of Asia?s
largest tropical grasslands and has for thousands of years supported large
populations of people and livestock. Understanding the historic dynamics
of this semi-arid system through paleoecological studies is particularly
important in the context of present day scenarios of changing climatic,
edaphic, grazing and fire regimes, to all of which this system is expected
to be especially sensitive. In this study, the past dynamics of semi-arid
vegetation and the drivers of vegetation change over the Holocene are
being assessed based on the reconstruction of past vegetation, climate,
herbivore abundance and fire events. This is done by analysing multiple
proxies such as pollen, phytolith, stable isotopes, fungal spores and
charcoal from sediment cores and by determining age of the sediment
layers. This study will enable us to better understand the biotic
responses of semi- arid systems to natural and anthropogenic factors. I
will discuss some of the preliminary results from the study. <br> Understanding the role of actin and myosin motors in the active
organization of molecules at the cell surface </br><br>The cell membrane is a laterally inhomogeneous entity composed
of lipids and proteins which are segregated into domains. This
organisation is crucial for both inside- out or outside-in signalling.
Previous work from the laboratory has shown that GPI anchored proteins and
model trans-membrane proteins with an actin binding domain are clustered
into nano-scale domains at the cell surface (Sharma et al., 2004; Goswami
et al., 2008; Gowrishankar et al., 2012). A theoretical framework was
proposed to explain the nano-clustering of GPI anchored proteins. It
envisages the presence of short dynamic actin filaments that are driven
into asters by myosin like motor activity (Gowrishankar et al., 2012)
along with which passive GPI anchored protein molecules get driven into
nanoscale clusters. In context of this framework there are two questions
that I will address in my talk:
i) How this framework applies to the organization of a specific membrane
protein in the cell membrane with the cell adhesion receptor CD44 as the
molecule of choice. CD44 is a dually palmitoylated trans-membrane cell
surface molecule with indirect interactions with actin, making it an
interesting candidate for our study. My experiment suggests that CD44might
form nano-clusters on the cell surface which is sensitive to cholesterol
levels and actin dynamics.
ii) The crucial role of Myosin in nano-clustering of GPI anchored proteins
where I will discuss my recent results in uncovering the role of myosin
isoforms in nanoclustering. <br> Effect of Diabetes on the Onset of Spermatogenesis in Rodents and
Reversibility of Sperm Function in Diabetic Adult Rats using dietary
curcumin. </br><br>STZ-induced diabetics are known exhibit quantitatively and
qualitatively poor spermatogenesis. This could be due to the elevated ROS
levels in the diabetic rats. To check whether or not a known potent
anti-oxidant can reverse the effect of diabetes on spermatogenesis, the
diabetic rats were treated with dietary curcumin and insulin was used as
positive control. The adult diabetic rats were treated with dietary
curcumin or insulin for a period of 50 days (approximately one
spermatogenic cycle). The body weight and blood glucose of dietary
curcumin treated diabetic animals was not restored to normal levels
whereas insulin could maintain both. On the other hand, curcumin could
restore testicular weight to the same extent as insulin. However, the
spermatogonial proliferation was higher in the curcumin treated animals
compared to the insulin treated animals. This could be attributed to the
anti-oxidant activity of dietary curcumin. Similarly, the number of
sonication-resistant testicular spermatids were also higher in the dietary
curcumin treated animals compared to the insulin treated group suggesting
that curcumin may be protecting via its anti-oxidant activity. <br> Investigating the molecular interplay in Ca2+ homeostasis in
Drosophila neurons </br><br>Signalling in neurons depends heavily on ionic oscillations and
Ca2+ plays a crucial role in different aspects of neuronal signalling and
function. Neuronal calcium homeostasis is widely attributed to fast Ca2+
entry through plasma membrane calcium channels gated by voltage or
neurotransmitters. Slow and sustained Ca2+ signal, generated through
intracellular and plasma membrane Ca2+ channels in response to external
stimuli, also plays an essential role in neuronal development and
function. At a given time, however, neurons observe and decode the net
output of calcium oscillations contributed by the entire cellular
machinery, the ?Ca2+ toolkit?, dedicated to sequestration, release or
entry of ionic Ca2+. Elucidating the mechanism by which neurons achieve
specificity and compensation of Ca2+ signals is an intriguing problem.
I am addressing the question of how IP3R, a Ca2+ channel in the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, orchestrate intracellular Ca2+
signals in Drosophila neurons. Neuronal requirement of IP3R during pupal
development has been demonstrated in context of growth and adult flight.
Calcium imaging from primary neuronal culture revealed absence of
store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) in neurons mutant for IP3R. SOCE is Ca2+
entry from extracellular milieu following depletion of ER store. However
neurons mutant for IP3R do not have any alteration in resting cytosolic or
ER store Ca2+ in spite of reduced IP3R mediated Ca2+ release and SOCE,
suggesting emergence of compensatory means of extracellular Ca2+ entry to
maintain intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis in absence of SOCE. An increase in
spontaneous Ca2+ influx mediated by PM Ca2+ channels has been observed in
IP3R mutant neurons lacking SOCE. Higher spontaneous influx can be
restored to normal level with restoration of SOCE in IP3R mutant neurons
by overexpression of STIM and Orai, the primary component of SOCE.
Modulation of SOCE and spontaneous Ca2+ influx in IP3R mutant neurons
confirms a central role of IP3R in neuronal Ca2+ homeostasis. Secondary
structure prediction, mutant analysis and investigation of intracellular
dynamics of IP3R, STIM and Orai suggest a physical requirement of IP3R in
functional organisation of Orai channels in the PM, possibly through its
interaction with scaffold protein(s) at the ER-PM junction. Regulation of
spontaneous Ca2+ influx in IP3R mutant neurons is currently under
investigation. <br> TGF-&#946; DEPENDENT FUNCTIONAL HETEROGENEITY OF CD66+ CELLS IN
HUMAN CERVICAL CANCER </br><br>Study from our lab have demonstrated that CD66+cells from
primary cervical cancers and cell line have features associated with
cancer stemness and metastasis (Bajaj, Maliekal et al., 2011 Cancer
Research) and this subset was maintained by Notch Signalling. CD66 is a
member of the Carcino embryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule gene family
and has been implicated in invasion and metastasis (Blumenthal et al
2005). More recent studies in our lab in collaboration with Laimonis
Laimin?s laboratory on an early cervical pre cancer cell line(CIN612)
reveal CD66+ cells with a hybrid gene expression pattern between
progenitors and differentiated cells along with neoplastic features. We
propose that CD66+ cells emerge as a consequence of the papilloma virus
life cycle (Pattabiraman et al . Submitted).
CD49f is a marker expressed by the cells at the basal layer of normal
cervix which harbours the stem cells and also proposed as a receptor for
HPV infection. In the current study using two markers- CD66 and CD49f we
have been able to delineate stemness from metastasis which is classically
considered to be tightly coupled properties. Our results suggest that TGF
beta might play a major role in metastasis by expanding the migratory and
cell cycle arrested CD66+ CD49f- cells. These cells on reaching the
distant organ might become CD49f+ proliferative cell to enable tumour
growth at the metastatic site. Our work suggests that at the same stage of
tumour low levels of TGF beta promotes tumour growth and high levels
promote metastasis. Therefore current drugs in clinical trial to inhibit
TGF beta might show only inadequate responses in the clinic. Possibly a
therapeutic strategy of simultaneously inhibiting the TGF signals to push
the cells to proliferative stage and targeting them with drugs like
Cisplatin would allow reducing tumour growth as well as metastasis. <br> What do we know of the patterns of species distributions in the
Himalayas? </br><br>Many factors affect species ranges. Some of these include
factors that are inherent to the ecology of the lineages considered and
some are abiotic and environmental. In this talk, I will present some work
that we are currently doing to understand the distribution of Niviventer
species in the Himalayas, and what that means for the biogeography of the
Himalayas.
Species of the genus Niviventer are largely distributed in Southeast Asia
and the Himalayas, with their richness peaking in southeast Asia and
Indo-China. 5 species (out of a total of 17 species globally) of
Niviventer are reported from the Himalayas. I will present preliminary
phylogenetic data of species sampled from the Himalayas during a recent
field trip, in this talk. <br> Impact of tertiary structured primary microRNA (ts-pri-miR) on the
splicing of its host gene. </br><br>The majority of human microRNAs are located in intronic regions
of the genome and are transcribed by RNA Polymerase II. Primary microRNA
transcripts are processed first by Drosha to give ~70nt pre-miRNAs and
then by Dicer to generate ~22nt mature microRNAs that then regulate gene
expression. Efficient and accurate mRNA biogenesis however, is achieved
through coupling of Pol II mediated transcription with RNA Splicing.
Recent studies indicate that intron cleavage by Drosha has no significant
effect on mature mRNA production. Intronic miRNAs are processed from
unspliced intronic regions wherein the Microprocessor complex can cleave
the miRNA between splicing commitment step and the excision step. This
suggests that a continuous intron is not required for splicing and that
the exons of nascent RNAs remain associated with the CTD of Pol II which
acts as landing pad for processing factors until the complete spliceosome
assembly.
Exon tethering during splicing of intronic pre-miRNAs indicate a kinetic
dependence between miRNA processing and intron splicing. My previous
study has shown that the tertiary structure (ts) of the pri-miR-17~92
poses a kinetic barrier to its processing into pre-miRNAs. My current
studies aim to investigate whether this structure also influences the
splicing of its host transcription unit, the C13orf25 also referred as
MIR17HG. The C13orf25 formed from human genomic locus on Chr13 is
upregulated in B-lymphomas and is known to undergo alternative splicing to
give two variants. In this AWS, I will discuss my results which suggests
that intronic miRNAs can act as regulatory elements for the splicing of
their host genes. <br> Database of genomic distribution of protein domain sequences and
developments in algorithm for comparison of protein domain architectures </br><br>rotein domains are structural, functional and evolutionary
units which are tinkered by nature to perform plethora of functions. There
are limited numbers of protein domain folds in nature. However, arranging
these protein domains in different combinations expands the functional
repertoire. These domain arrangements differ in composition and order of
identical or different protein domains which is referred as protein domain
architectures. Conservation of these domain architectures preserves their
functions across species, whereas varying them allows a basic catalytic
machinery to be used in diverse biological processes. Protein domains are
organized into different hierarchies like domain, family, superfamily,
fold, class as recorded in the SCOP database. In the present study, we
focus on protein structural domains at the superfamily level, their
sequence homologues and their domain architectures. In this talk, I will
elaborate the process of updating GenDiS database, which organizes the
sequence homologues of structural domains at superfamily level based on
their genomic and taxonomic distribution. I will explain various features
incorporated in this database. ADASS, a domain architecture-based
algorithm, earlier developed in the lab, will be implemented to compare
similarities within domain superfamilies. I will also discuss recent
improvements in the ADASS algorithm, its implementation on domain
architecture set of tyrosine phosphatase containing gene products across
different taxonomic levels. I will also discuss future strategies for
tracing evolution of individual domains in a domain-centric dataset of
domain architectures. <br> Rice Response to Salinity and Drought stress - Same or Different? </br><br>Production?of rice is challenged by several environmental
factors and most common among them are Salinity and?Drought.?Both of these
manifest as?different?forms?of?water deficit for?plants. ?While salinity

are used by rice varieties under the given stress conditions. <br> Native state dynamics of the prion protein probed by hydrogen
exchange and mass spectrometry </br><br>The prion protein (PrPC) appears to be unusually susceptible to
conformational change, and unlike nearly all other proteins, it can easily
be made to convert to alternative misfolded conformations (PrPSc), which
is the key event in prion pathogenesis (1). The easy convertibility of
PrPC is indicative of a conformationally flexible native form and in fact,
the conformational flexibility of the native form has been reported to be
critical in prion conversion (2). A quantitative understanding of the
basis of this structural plasticity in terms of stability of the protein
by a detailed thermodynamic characterization of unfolding of the mouse
prion protein indicated high levels of structural fluctuations in the
native state (N) of the protein as indicated by an unusually high native
state heat capacity (3).
In the present study, I have characterized, structurally and
energetically, the native state of the wild type prion protein in solvent
conditions where it has a high propensity to convert into aggregated
forms, using HX in conjunction with proteolytic fragmentation and mass
spectrometry: a probe sensitive to the presence of minimally populated
conformations. The native state of the prion protein seems to be at
equilibrium with multiple, sparsely populated, non-native conformers which
remain otherwise undetected by global probes.
 It seems possible that these sparsely populated nonnative conformations
(N* states) may act as monomeric precursors to misfolded oligomeric
forms, thereby initiating the conversion of monomer to multiple misfolded
conformations, as identified for few other proteins. In my talk, in
addition to the above results, I would discuss future experiments
designed so as to observe and characterize such solvent accessible
conformations in disease associated mutant prion proteins.

of its six legs. Mechanical properties of appendages and action of
specific muscles by motor neurons presumably play a key role but the exact
nature of their contributions is not clear. The source of input to motor
neurons and the emergence of patterned output are even less well
understood. To identify the circuitry elements involved in controlling the
coordinated leg movements, we knocked down neurotransmitter receptors on
motor neurons and checked for walking defects using soot assay. We
demonstrate defective walking patterns upon developmental knockdown of
excitatory glutamate receptors and inhibitory GABAergic receptors.
Specific knockdown of the neurotransmitter receptors in adults also
results in defective walking behaviour. We are also developing a paradigm
for free walking flies and for more detailed, automated analysis of this
behaviour. We are now able to quantify this behavior using eight basic
parameters such as: swing amplitude, swing duration, stance duration,
anterior extreme leg position, posterior extreme leg position,
contra-lateral co-ordination index, ipsi-lateral co-ordination index and
leg-body angle. Built on top of these we are using three derived
parameters that specifically quantify the co-ordination modes often found
in walking flies such as tripod gait, tetrapod gait and wave-like gait. We
aim to describe walking in wild type flies and in genetically perturbed
backgrounds using these parameters and hope to unravel the mechanisms
underlying adult fly walking. <br> Naive state specific modulation of mitochondrial potential by
serotonin in mammalian pluripotent cells </br><br>In my earlier work, I have shown that serotonin is present in
mouse and human ESCs and that some of the serotonin co-localizes to the
mitochondria. Exogenous addition of serotonin also causes a decrease in
the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in both cell types. However,
addition of serotonin showed a significant difference in its effect on
mitochondrial potential - mESCs showed an increase while hESCs showed no
change. This may reflect the inherent differences in the mitochondria of
these two cell types - mESCs i.e. ?na?ve? cells and hESCs i.e. ?primed?
cells which has been reported earlier.
To investigate this difference in the effect of serotonin on mitochondrial
potential between the two cell types, I attempted to convert typical
?primed? hESCs to the ?na?ve? state and characterize them. Human ESCs
being converted to the ?na?ve? state show differences in various
mitochondrial properties and their mitochondria now show an increase in
potential with exogenous serotonin. ?Na?ve? cells seem to respond to
serotonin unlike ?primed? cells. This may be based on inherent metabolic
differences between the two states and could be of potential use in
isolating ?na?ve? cells from ?primed? pluripotent cells and somatic cells.
We are at present trying to determine the mechanism involved. <br> The influence of early life enrichment on the neurobiological
effects of stress. </br><br>The amygdala and hippocampus exhibit strikingly different
patterns of plasticity in response to both positive and negative
experiences. For example, aversive experiences like chronic stress
strengthen amygdala-dependent cued fear memory and its cellular correlates
in the basolateral amygdala, while impairing hippocampal plasticity and
spatial memory. Paradoxically, positive experiences like environmental
enrichment reduce cued fear memory and amygdalar LTP, while hippocampal
plasticity and spatial memory are enhanced. This raises some intriguing
questions, such as - can the contrasting plasticity patterns of enriched
environment and stress counterbalance each other? Does an enriched brain
develop resilience to stress?
 As a behavioural readout of hippocampal and amygdalar function, we
tested for contextual fear memory formation using a paradigm that
severely restricts the amount of time given to the hippocampus to
encode its spatial context. In this paradigm, the amygdala
processes the aversive stimulus (foot shock), while the hippocampus
encodes the spatial context in which the animal receives the shock.
Together they encode the association of the spatial context with the
shock. While control and chronically stressed rats both showed low
freezing responses indicating poor contextual memory, enriched
animals showed a robust expression of the same memory.
Interestingly, stressed rats that were raised in an enriched
environment showed an even stronger recall of fear memory. In order
to study the individual contributions of the hippocampus and the
amygdala to this enhanced fear memory, we used the expression of the
immediate early gene, c-Fos, as an activity marker to look at
patterns of neuronal activity during the formation and recall of
contextual fear memory. In naive animals, that are not subjected to
any behavioural stimuli, we find that an enriched housing followed
by stress increases the density of c-Fos-positive cells in the
basolateral amygdala. These rats also have a higher density of
c-Fos-positive cells in their basolateral amygdala during fear
memory recall. In addition, chronically stressed animals as well as
those housed in an enriched environment show a greater density of
c-Fos-positive cells in the basolateral amygdala during recall but
not in naive animals. Thus we see that the increase in c-Fos
positive cells during recall in animals that have been enriched and
then stressed correlates with their strong contextual fear memory. 
However, in order to assess the contribution of the hippocampus to
this robust fear memory, we now need to look at neuronal activity in
the hippocampus of the same animals. <br> RNApol2 control in Quiescent cells: Balanced on Knife edge </br><br>Adult stem cells mostly exist in a quiescent state (G0),
persist within tissues and contribute to their regeneration. Earlier
characterized as hibernation, characterized by basal rates of RNA &
protein synthesis, G0 is now emerging as a balanced state where both the
cell cycle and tissue-specific programs are held in check by active
mechanisms. Our approach to understanding quiescence is by contrast to
another non-proliferative state i.e. terminal differentiation, using
skeletal muscle myoblasts as a model. We find that in G0 myoblasts
compared to differentiate d myotubes, despite global repression, many
genes are induced or maintained by chromatin regulation, and hypothesize
that the ?repressed? quiescent genome is poised for activation.
We used global analysis of RNA pol2 regulation to investigate the
quiescence-specific program. First, we find that the proportion of
transcribing pol2 (Ser2p & Ser5p) is greatly reduced in quiescent
myoblasts vs. differentiated myotubes. Second, ChIP-Seq analysis indicates
that compared to proliferating myoblasts (MB), both differentiated
myotubes (MT) & quiescent (G0) cells show increased promoter-proximal pol2
pausing. However, genes specifically paused in G0 represent both cell
cycle genes (expressed in Mb but not in MT/G0) and myogenic genes
(expressed in MT but not in MB/G0). Thus, differential pol2 pausing may
play a key role in these distinct cellular states. Pol2 pausing is
reported to be the rate-limiting step in quiescent lymphocytes (Kouzine
et al. Cell, 153, 2013), where transcriptional amplification accompanies
cell cycle activation. Our study additionally shows that pausing occurs on
transcriptionally silent genes in G0 compared to terminally arrested
cells, and suggests specific regulation of the program of reversible
quiescence. I would discuss inferences drawn specifically for regulation
of myogenic program in quiescence. <br> Activity patterns in dissociated cultures </br><br>We analyze recordings of neural activity in dissociated
hippocampal cultures obtained with high density microelectrode array
recordings. In those recordings, electrodes are so close together that the
extracellular potential of a single neuron can be picked up by several
electrodes. We demonstrate that this can be exploited in retinal
recordings to identify single units. For cultures however, the same
estimation of current sources yields a rather ambiguous picture. A
comparison with an image of a culture shows that neurons tend cluster
together and are hence cannot clearly be separated by their location. We
thus based all subsequent analysis on the estimated locations of
individual spikes rather than clustering them into arbitrary units. We
find noisy recording channels based on the lack of correlated activity,
and further observe that clusters with a relatively uniform spatial
density of spikes can be subdivided based on their activity patterns. <br> Presynaptic mechanisms of mGluR-dependent synaptic plasticity:
Implications for the state of synapses in Fragile X Syndrome. </br><br>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading heritable cause of
intellectual disability and autism, caused by transcriptional silencing of
the Fmr1 gene and loss of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP).
The seminal mGluR theory of fragile X syndrome, primarily developed from
studies in the hippocampus and cortex,postulates that most FXS phenotypes
are a consequence of excessive mGluR5 signaling.Although strong emotional
symptoms are major debilitating factors in FXS patients and likely
involves the amygdala, little is known about the synaptic and molecular
basis of amygdala dysfunction in FXS.Interestingly, while mGluR activation
leads to long-term depression (LTD) in the hippocampus,the same treatment
inthe amygdala leads tolong-term potentiation (LTP).The underlying
mechanism of the mGluR-LTP phenomenon in the amygdala is completely
unexplored, and is therefore the key focus of my project.Preliminary
studiesdemonstrated a dramatic 50% increase in the frequency of miniature
excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs)in the amygdala after
mGluR5stimulationwith the agonist - 3,5 dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG),
suggestingthat presynaptic mechanisms are at play during the induction of
amygdalar mGluR-LTP. Surprisingly, similar studies in the hippocampus
demonstrated decreasedfrequency of mEPSCs upon mGluR stimulation,
potentially contributing to hippocampal mGluR-LTD.Thus, we hypothesize
that the contrasting effects on presynaptic vesicle release
mechanimsfollowing mGluR5 stimulation underlie the contrasting patterns of
synaptic plasticity observed in these two brain regions.
Presynaptic vesicle release is significantly impaired in FXS across all
brain areas, leading us to hypothesize that FMRP directly regulates
properties of presynaptic vesicle cycling. Indeed, we identified specific
presynaptic mRNA targets that physically and functionally interact with
FMRP and whose protein products are known to directly regulate membrane
trafficking at the synapse by modulatingpresynaptic vesicle docking,
primingand recycling (Rab3 pathway, Amphiphysin) at the active zone.In
addition, I will discuss the use of vGLUT1-PHluorin imaging to study
presynaptic vesicle release properties in amygdala cultures that we
recently developed. <br> A mechanical basis of wing and haltere co-ordination in the
Dipteran thorax </br><br>Dipteran insects are capable of extremely rapid, precisely
controlled maneuvers during flight. Halteres, the modified hind wings,
provide rapid mechanosensory feedback and help stabilize flight.
Theyoscillate at wing beat frequencies.However, as the two wings oscillate
precisely in-phase to each other, the halteres moves exactly anti-phase to
the wings. Both wings and halteres of these miniaturized flies oscillate
at frequencies exceeding 100Hz. Such high wing beat frequencies are
enabled by specialized myogenic muscles butthe mechanism by which wing
haltere coordination is achieved is unknown. We have identified a network
of mechanical linkages in the Dipteran thorax that are responsible for
both phase and frequency coordination.Based on these linkages, we propose
a mechanical model of the thorax and through a series of perturbation
experiments we further characterize the nature of these mechanical
linkages. Our data suggests that wings and halteres act as coupled
oscillators. <br> Characterization of structural transitions which lead to solvent
exposure during protein unfolding under native-like conditions </br><br>Structural transitions which lead tochanges in solvent exposure
in different parts of a protein contribute much of the free energy change
during unfolding. A detailed understanding of the steps during unfolding
is very important in order to understand the conformational changes which
convert a stable native structure into an intermediate state with solvent
exposed patches, making it aggregation prone.These structural transitions
accompany the conversion from the relatively ?dry? molten globule (DMG)
intermediateto the ?wet? molten globule (WMG) intermediate, and finally to
the fully unfolded state. While the former is resistant to the entry of
water, the latter is largely solvated. Secondary structure is maintained
and tertiary structure is disrupted in both the DMG and the WMG. The aim
of the present study was to detect and structurally characterize partially
unfolded intermediatesby directly monitoring site-specific solvent
exposure using two high resolution probes: thiol labeling (SX) which
probes the exposure of side chains and thereby monitors tertiary
structural transitions, and hydrogen exchange coupled to mass spectrometry
(HX-MS) which probes the exposure of backbone amides, and thereby monitors
secondary structural transitions. A comparison of the changes in tertiary
and secondary structure, which lead to solvent exposure,will allow the
detected intermediates to be identified more accurately with the dry and
wet globules.
Thiol labeling, carried out under native-like conditions, identified very
rare structural opening events and showed that side chain exposure takes
place in multiple steps during unfolding. The initial results on HX-MS
indicate that changes in secondary structure also take place through the
population of multiple intermediateforms. <br> Role of ly-6 family protein CD59 in the surface redistribution of
nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor </br><br>The Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is a long-term surface
resident protein, and its localization and maintenance at synapses is
important for neuronal transmission. It is one of the best-characterized
ligand-gated ion channel, and its distribution in cells is proposed to be
important for synaptic plasticity.
My previous work shows that there is an increase in the src kinase
phosphorylation as well as Rac1 GTPase recruitment downstream of AChR
ligation. There is a change in cellular actin polymerization and a
quantitative increase in the amount of F-actin following AChR ligation.
Ligation of AChR leads to a dynamic and actively patterned state of actin
machinery.
nAChR exhibits organization at the supra-molecular scale; it occurs as
optically resolvable dynamic micron-scale clusters which are in turn
composed of nanoscale clusters as resolved by STED microscopy. These
nanoscale clusters reorganize upon cross-linking by monoclonal antibodies
and by cholesterol depletion [3]. Using STED microscopy, I have shown that
the nanoscale clustering of the nAChR at the cell surface is sensitive to
perturbations of actin and actin-interacting and actin-regulatory proteins
such as cortactin and &#61537;-actinin.

Furthermore nAChR ligation also locally affects membrane composition,
monitored by observing the distribution of nanoclusters of GPI-tethered
proteins (whose existence at the plasma membrane reflects underlying
actin-coupled membrane composition [4]).
Local membrane concentration of nAChR can be regulated endogenously by
ly-6 family member proteins such as Lynx-1 and CD59. These molecules are
GPI anchored and belong to and possess the same structural moiety as the
AChR antagonistic ligand &#61537;-Bungarotoxin. They have also been shown
to affect the CNS nAChR electrophysiological properties give ref].. Here,
I will present evidence that ly-6 family molecule CD59 regulates the
plasma membrane surface distribution of muscle nAChR by affecting their
surface concentration as well as local composition of AChR clusters. It
does so by affecting changing the dynamics of the underlying actin
cytoskeleton, reminiscent of dynamics induced by a-Bungarotoxin as well as
mAb35. The redistribution seems to happen by sequesteration into surface
connected compartments and not via an endocytic process per se.
These observations suggest that upon ligation, either via the
antagonistic ligand Bungarotoxin, or via other molecules of the same
protein family, which are found endogenously in the same milieu and
interact with nAChR, nAChR is capable of self-organizing its local
membrane environment by its intrinsic ability to engage with a dynamic
actin mechanics.

an area of intense research. How the mechanisms required for the repair and
renewal are put in place during early development remains poorly
understood. In vertebrates muscle activity and occasionally, injury
activates plethora of regenerative mechanisms including so-called muscle
stem cell (MuSC). The developmental origin of adult stem cell remains a
mystery in terms of their developmental origin in vertebrates.
We address this question in the developing muscles of Drosophila and
discover the developmental role of muscle stem cells and test their roles
in repair and regeneration. Using MARCM based linage lead to discovery of
muscle stem cell during flight muscle development. Histological analysis of
the wing imaginal disc subsequently revealed the presence of a stem-cell
niche required for maintenance of stem-ness of these cells.
Vertebrate stem-cells were first identified by the anatomical location of
these cells close to myofibres, (A. Mauro in 1961). We bsimilarly find
cells adjacent to Drosophila muscle related lineally to muscle stem cells.
Assays designed to pin down the functional significance of these cells
suggest an important role in the flight muscles regeneration. A search for
the pathway regulating this phenomenon lead to a view that Delta-Notch
signalling may be involved. In summary, this study identifies the
previously unknown muscle stem cells and niche involved in early
myogenesis of Drosophila. In the later stage these cells remain unfused
and possibly function as stem cells which possibly play a role in repair. <br> Clathrin-independent endocytosis of Wingless is necessary for
productive engagement with Frizzled receptors and Wingless signalling
inDrosophila wing discs </br><br>Robust morphogen gradients orchestrate tissue patterning in a
metazoan. Wingless, a Wnt family member is a morphogen that is secreted
locally and by engaging with its receptor, DFrizzled2, sets up a
signalling cascade that patterns the dorso-ventral axes of wingimaginal
discs. Here we show that in the wing disc, Wingless is secreted locally
but is sequestered by GPI-anchored proteins at the surface of recipient
cells making it unavailable for productive engagement with DFrizzled2.
Subsequently, Wingless is endocytosed via a clathrin-independent pathway
into acidic endosomes, which fuse with clathrin-dependent pathway derived
endosomes carrying DFrizzled2. This culminates in a low-pH dependent
transfer of Wingless to DFrizzled2, resulting in a signalling gradient
across the wing imaginal disc. Thus, the Wingless signalling pattern is
established by two distinct endocytosis pathways, emphasizing the
importance of endocytosis in tissue morphogenesis. This mechanism, allows
cells to autonomously control the uptake of the morphogen, independent of
its signalling receptor. <br> The evolution of a hybrid membrane trafficking system in a hybrid
yeast </br><br>We are interested in the ancient origins of the eukaryotic
compartmentalized cell plan. The focus is on understanding the process of
organellar diversification in the context of non-endosymbiotic organelles.
Since 'Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor' (LECA) was already a fairly
complex organism, the time period we are addressing is post the original
eukaryogenesis event (~ 2.5 billion years ago (BYA)) till LECA (~1.8 BYA).
Hypothesis proposed by Dacks and Field (2007) suggests that a new
organelle can be generated by the gene family expansion of ?complete set?
of budding and fusion molecules associated with an existing organelle
followed by their divergence into specifically interacting subsets.This
hypothesis requires a biological process which ensures the concomitant
duplication of an entire set of molecules and the elimination of
cross-talk across the different sets. Here, we explore the possible role
of hybridization in driving organellar diversification through the study
of recent hybrid speciation events. In the talk, I will discuss a 500 year
old hybridization of ale-beer brewing yeast, S.cerevisiae and S.eubayanus
from Patagonia (Argentina) to give rise to the lager beer brewing yeast,
S.pastorianus. I shall first present genome-scale patterns of gene gains
and losses, divergence etc and then focus specifically onto the vesicular
transport system of the hybrid. <br> Super Seedlings: Pulsed rainfall does not alter above ground
growth of dry forest tree seedlings </br><br>Dry forests are one of the most threatened ecosystems in India.
Conversion of dry forests into human agricultural and settlement areas is
one of the major reasons for their decline. Tree species that make up
these forests are known to be extremely drought-resistant and the seedling
stage is when maximum mortality occurs. Rainfall patterns throughout India
are predicted to become more pulsed as a result of climate change. In
order to investigate the effect of more pulsed rainfall regimes on dry
forests I conducted a pots experiment on 950 seedlings of 19 dry forest
tree species. I subjected the seedlings to two watering regimes; a
control treatment which received water every 3 days and a pulsed treatment
which received water every 12 days. Despite finding that soil moisture
levels were different as a result of the two treatment, we found that
there were no differences in the above-ground growth of the groups. This
shows how resilient these plants are to water stress even at the seedling
stage. Key traits that may provide clues as to why these plants are
apparently unaffected by the pulsed regime, include root biomass, root and
stem architecture as well as stomatal densities. <br> RAG1 and pBase: Structure and Mechanism </br><br>In the vertebrate immune system, somatic recombination of V, D
and J gene segments leads to the formation of Immunoglobulin and T cell
receptor genes that give rise to receptors with distinct specificities.
The lymphoid specific RAG1 and RAG2 enzymes play an important role in
initiation of V(D)J recombination process. RAG1 binds to recombination
signal sequences (RSSs) and introduces a nick at RSS and coding gene
segment border. The RSS is made up of conserved heptamer and nonamer
sequences. RAG1 is predicted to have three distinct domains, the N
terminal domain, central domain and C terminal domain. Out of them, the
central domain is responsible to recognize heptamer sequence. Biochemical
studies have shown that central domain has greater affinity for single
stranded heptamer sequence rather than double stranded heptamer. I aim to
study the interaction b/w central domain of RAG1 and the RSS heptamer.
Transposase is one of the mutator enzymes that mediates movement of
specialized genetic elements termed as transpososn. Among them, the
piggybac transposon isolated from cabbage looper moth Trichoplusia ni
shows active transposition in mammalian cells. The cognate transposase
enzyme pBase is the primary mediator of the mobility of piggybac within
the genome. Inverted repeat sequence makes the binding region for pBase
enzyme to initiate transposition mechanism. Using a combination of
biochemical and structural tools, I aim to elucidate the mechanism of
action of the pBase enzyme. The progress made in these two studies will be
presented. <br> Translational regulation underlying Long Term Habituation in
Drosophila: genetic and molecular interactions between Ataxin-2, FMRP and
CaMKII </br><br>Inactive synapses contain a pool of mRNAs that are sequestered
by RNA Binding Proteins in a translationally repressed state. Activity
induced de-repression leading to local translation is crucial for Long
Term Memory formation. In a highly accessible synapse that previous work
from our lab has identified to underlie short term and Long Term
Habituation (LTH) in Drosophila, we are studying the in-vivo mechanism of
memory associated neuronal translational regulation. The study mainly
focuses on two disease associated proteins, FragileX Mental Retardation
Protein (FMRP) and Ataxin2 which are candidate RNA binding proteins with
likely roles in microRNA mediated translational regulation of mRNAs. They
are also components of neuronal RiboNuclear Particles (RNP) that are foci
of translational regulation in neurons.
Initial work showed that Atx2 and FMRP are required in olfactory
interneurons specifically for LTH and associated functional plasticity.
Genetic interactions among FMRP and Atx2 along with other proteins like
Me31B and Ago1 were also required for LTH, indicating they function in a
micro RNA dependent manner for LTH. Consistently, knockdown of these
proteins in olfactory interneurons, results in increased expression of a
CaMKII based translational reporter, indicating they act together on
common transcripts required for LTH.To strengthen these evidences, using
novel Immunoprecipitation (IP) strategies, in-vivo interaction among FMRP,
Atx2 and CaMKII transcript was tested. Results demonstrate that FMRP and
Atx2 interact with one another and regulate, by direct association, common
transcripts such as CaMKII that are required for long term habituation.
These results provide insight into the in vivo mechanisms of long-term
memory (LTM)-associated synaptic plasticity and into the roles of FMRP and
Atx2 in neuronal translational control.

kinase dPIP4K: </br><br>Phosphoinositides are important signaling molecules that
regulate multiple cellular functions. These molecules are generated by
lipid kinases that differentially phosphorylate the inositol head group in
phosphatidylinositol. Phosphatidylinositol 5 phosphate 4 kinase (PIP4K) is
one such enzyme that catalyzes the addition of phosphate molecule at 4
position to the substrate PI5P to generate PI(4,5)P2. Mammalian genomes
contain three genes that encode the PIP4K activity called &#61537;,
&#61538; and &#61543; where as the Drosophila genome has a single gene
encoding this activity (dPIP4K).
Loss-of-function mutants of dPIP4K in Drosophila are homozygous viable but
show delay in larval development and reduced body weight. This growth
defect is underpinned by a reduction in cell size but not cell number. The
reduction in cell size is associated with a reduction in the molecular
output of the TOR complex although the mechanism underlying this is
unclear. Studies are being carried out to understand the various signaling
pathways that feed in signals to TOR complex and where in this large
network is the function of dPIP4K required for regulation of cell size.

through Intracellular Calcium Signaling </br><br>Calcium (Ca2+) is a versatile signaling molecule that regulates
various cellular processes which in turn modulate many organismal
behavior. In order to achieve this versatility, Ca2+ levels inside the
cell are perceived as signals in many different ways (1). To generate Ca2+
signals, some extracellular signaling molecules like hormones and
neurotransmitters bind and activate G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR)
which in turn activate phospholipase C&#946; (PLC&#946;). PLC&#946;
cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate inositol
1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 binds to the IP3 Receptor, a ligand gated
Ca2+ channel on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, creating a surge of
Ca2+ release from the ER (2). IP3 receptor is one of the most important
components of the Ca2+ signaling toolkit.
My goal is to find other important molecules of this Ca2+ signaling
pathway which are required for the initiation of this cascade i.e.
G-protein coupled receptors. It has been shown that reduced levels of IP3R
on pan neuronal (C155GAL4) expression of an itpr transgene dsRNA result in
flight defects (3). Hence, this suggests that IP3R mediated calcium
signaling in neurons in required for regulation of flight.
I have done a genetic screen to identify GPCRs that function through IP3R
mediated calcium signaling and regulate flight in drosophila. The screen
helped in identification of five such GPCRs. Out of five, one receptor
called Frizzled-2 receptor (dFz2) was found to function through calcium
signaling, however not through G-protein Gq. Hence, we have investigated
the signaling mechanism that dFz2 employs to regulate flight in
drosophila. We have also investigated the neuronal phenotype of
down-regulation of dFz2 that leads to flight defects.
This study has allowed us to identify G-protein Go as the potential
regulator of dFz2 signaling linking it to calcium signaling. Also, we were
able to identify a specific dopaminergic neuronal cluster that requires
dFz2 mediated calcium signaling to regulate flight in drosophila.

mechanical, chemical and thermodynamic balance conditions both in the bulk
and at the interface. These conditions lead to relations between the
intensive quantities in the two phases, such as equality of temperature,
chemical potentials, and the Young-Laplace equation for force balance .
Dynamical description of the phases away from equilibrium have been given
by generalizing the single phase non-equilibrium thermodynamics by
including the boundary conditions at the interface. The aim of this work
we will generalize the bulk and interface conditions to the case of two
coexisting active fluid phases.
This formal study of coexistence of active phases is motivated by the
various observations showing existence of macroscopic non-membrane bound
structures in the cell. In many of these cases it has been suggested that
the structures are fluid like and ATP dependent. Large scale lipid
segregation within cell membrane, spatial localization of RabGTPase
domains in cytoplasm, chromosome territories and nucleoli in nucleoplasm
are some of the examples. <br> Regulators of sigma factor competition in E.coli </br><br>The bacterial RNA polymerase requires a bound sigma factor to
recognize promoters. In E.coli, seven sigma factors compete to bind to RNA
polymerase and direct transcription. 6S RNA and Rsd are hypothesized to
regulate the competition between the housekeeping sigma factor &#963;70
and alternative sigma factors, particularly the stationary phase sigma
factor, &#963;38. 6S RNA binds to the RNA polymerase complex containing
&#963;70, whereas Rsd binds to free &#963;70. Despite multiple studies,
the function of these regulators remains unclear. I will describe an
RNA-Seq experiment comparing the transcriptome of wild-type E.coli with
strains lacking 6S RNA and/or Rsd, in five growth phases. While the effect
of 6S RNA and Rsd on gene expression varies with growth phase, absence of
either of them results in a small decrease in expression across many
&#963;38 targets. This experiment shows that Rsd and 6S RNA influence
transcription through a complex network of interactions: by regulating the
transcription of each other, RNA polymerase, sigma factors and global
regulators. <br> Understanding the effects of tropical rainforest fragmentation on
tree communities and carbon storage: a functional traits approach </br><br>Tropical forests are among the largest terrestrial storehouses
of carbon, and thereby play a crucial role in regulating global climate.
Tropical forests are increasingly fragmented and disturbed, resulting in
marked shifts in their structure and functioning, as well as the carbon
stored by these ecosystems. Fragmentation creates gradients at a variety
of scales, ranging from abiotic edge effects at local scales to isolation
related to habitat quality and configuration at the landscape scale. These
affect tree communities and the carbon they store by altering key
ecological processes related to establishment, survival, reproduction and
dispersal. Here, we use an analysis of plant functional traits to examine
the effects of forest fragmentation on tree community composition and
carbon storage potential in a tropical rainforest landscape in India's
Western Ghats Mountains. We identify which traits act as response traits
and predict tree community turnover in response to fragmentation, and
examine variation in the effect traits which determine carbon storage
potential. By assessing the nature and strength of various
trait-fragmentation interactions, we draw insights into the likely
processes driving shifts in tree community composition and carbon storage
potential in response to forest fragmentation. <br> Multisensory integration in the antennal motor system of hawkmoths </br><br>During flight, most insects position their antennae in a
definite relationship relative to their head. A set of mechanosensory
organs called B?hm's bristles located at the base of the antennae, are
necessary for antennal positioning response. Mechanosensory neurons
underlying the B?hm's bristles sense any deviation from the set point and
activate the antennal muscles to correct for this deviation. The antennal
muscles also receive information from other modalities such vision and
air flow, and likely also olfaction. These multisensory inputs are
integrated by the antennal motor system to dynamically position the
antennae. It is not however clear how the antennal motor neurons combine
this information, and also how their response changes depending on
context. To study these questions, I plan to use a two-pronged approach
that involves experimentation and computational modeling. On the
experimental front, I plan to investigate the role of Johnston's organs,
which are putative air flow sensors, on antennal positioning response. On
the computational front, I have been developing a simple method to
quantify how various fields of Bohm's bristles around the antennal base
are activated during movements of the antenna. Eventually, I hope to
develop a model of sensory-motor integration of the antennal positioning
response that combines inputs from various modalities. <br> Population genetic and morphological signatures of adaptation to
human commensalism in rats: A comparative study </br><br>Human activities result in large scale ecosystem modifications,
consequently affecting a range of different organisms. Although a majority
 of these species have been affected negatively, some have exploited the
anthropic habitats and have adapted to a ?commensal? lifestyle alongside
humans. In consequence, these animals have successfully colonised all
parts of the world, alongside humans as their host. We studied two species
of the *Rattus* genus, *R. rattus* and *R. satarae* in the Western
Ghats. In the last AWS, I presented results of two years of field work,
which suggest that *R. rattus* was predominantly captured in villages, a
commensal species, whereas *R. satarae* is only captured from forests, a
non ? commensal species. In this AWS, I will explore the population
differentiation of both these species in the perspective of commensalism.
 I hypothesise that by virtue of human commensalism, *R. rattus* would
have much lower genetic differentiation across this complex landscape
than *R. satarae*. In addition, I will discuss my ongoing work on
morphological variation on both the species. <br> Role of visual landmarks during odor searching behavior of fruit
flies, D. melanogaster </br><br>Fruit flies can track attractive food odors over long
distances. The sense of smell is well developed in many animals and
assists them to find food sources, mates and avoid potential threats.
Fruit flies like most other flying insects, are known to utilize visual
information from the surroundings to assist them during odor tracking.
Yet, we don?t know how flies make their final decision about landing on or
near the odor source. At distances close to the odor, distant visual cues
are not sufficient to gauge relative distances between fly and the source.
We tested flies? landing accuracy on the odor source in the presence of
visual landmarks in the vicinity. Interestingly, addition of visual cues
around the odor source not only decreases landing accuracy but also
increases the deviation of flies away from the odor cues during free
flight approaches. Nevertheless, majority of flies successfully manage to
land within 1cm of
the odor source position. We observed that for the most part of their free
flight journey, flies spent very little time in the odor plumes except
prior to landing. Our data suggests that flies searches for maximum
overlap between odor and visual cues to make a landing decision. This
simple algorithm can explain the reasonably high landing accuracy even in
the presence of visual clutter. Free flight behavior of fruit flies is
highly variable and to observe general trends one would require a large
data set. Also, analyzing tens of thousands of images for 3d positions of
flies is a time intensive process. To counter these shortcomings we have
recently set-up a high throughput filming apparatus which can auto-track
free flight behavior of multiple flies in real time. <br> Converging evolutionary strategies redress gene expression
imbalances caused by the loss of a global gene silencing system in E. coli </br><br>Bacteria respond to variety of environment by altering their
gene expression. Transcription factors regulate gene expression either by
activating or by silencing the transcription of genes depending on the
requirement of the gene product at a particular growth phase. For
instance, stress response genes and most of the horizontally acquired
genes are kept silenced during the exponential phase of the growth by gene
regulators.
In this study we tried to understand how the loss of transcription factors
affect the controlled expression in bacteria and how bacteria adapt to
downstream effect of the loss of transcription factors. To understand this
we chose H-NS and StpA, an important gene silencing system of E. coli. We
made a deletion mutant lacking the genes encoding these two proteins in E
. coli. We observed that this deletion resulted in loss of fitness and
imbalance in the controlled gene expression. Further, to understand how
bacteria compensates for the loss of global regulators; we evolved the
deletion mutant under laboratory conditions to check whether any
compensatory mutations can reverse the deletion mutant from its defective
phenotype and from its uncontrolled gene expression. We used in-vitro
laboratory evolution experiments followed by deep sequencing of the genome
and trancriptome of the evolved strains to address our question. I will be
talking about the mutations, which we identified, and its effect on
reversing the fitness and gene expression of the deletion mutants. <br> Role of IP3 signalling in Drosophila Larval Neurons Regulating
Nutrient Sensing </br><br>Inositol (1,4,5) trisphosphate (IP3) is a secondary messenger
that mediates the release of intracellular calcium via the IP3R
(IP3Receptor or itpr gene) which plays an important role in controlling a
variety of Ca2+ dependent cellular functions. G Protein Coupled Receptors
(GPCRs), present on the plasma membrane help convert the extracellular
stimuli to intracellular signals and induce signal transduction. IP3
signalling is known to be mediated through GPCRs. The role of itpr in
Drosophila metabolic stress response has been established in the lab. I
have previously shown that the requirement of IP3R for metabolic stress
response is neuronal. In order to identify the GPCRs involved in the
neuronal IP3R mediated nutrient sensing process, a genetic RNAi screen
was performed which I will discuss. Also, by genetic and imaging
experiments, we find that the requirement of IP3R for metabolic stress
response is particularly important in certain neurons of the larval
ventral ganglia. These neurons appear to be the primary responders to
nutrient deprivation. <br> Gene flow dynamics between two Indian fruit bats </br><br>Sympatry provides an opportunity to understand speciation
dynamics and the biology of isolation between divergent lineages. The
identification and study of hybrid zones remains a major challenge when
interacting species overlap in morphology. The Cynopterine fruit bats
present such an interesting case allowing the evaluation of the
evolutionary consequences of sympatry. Using a set of nuclear
microsatellite markers we had previously demonstrated the presence of
ancient gene flow. In the present study, we have used reduced
representation libraries (ddRAD) to obtain thousands of SNPs across the
genome of 48 individuals from both species. We further addressed the
question of gene flow and present our findings. <br> Spatial and Temporal Effects of Immobilisation Stress in Rats </br><br>The effects of stress on an organism can be diverse. Stress can
affect different brain regions differently, showing region-specific
?spatial? effects. For example, chronic stressors have been known to cause
an up regulation of structure and function in the amygdala. This is
paralleled with a down regulation of the same in the hippocampus. These
observations come from both studies of stress disorder patients as well as
rodent models of stress. In addition, emerging evidence of a directional
influence of the amygdala on the hippocampus during stress suggests that
the former might be responsible for modulating the effects of stress on
long distance targets. The primary aim of my work is to examine this
hypothesis with respect to interactions between the amygdala and the
Medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC). As a first step, I have characterised
molecular and structural changes due to chronic stress in the mPFC.
Interestingly, I have observed sub-region specific effects on neurotrophin
levels and morphology due to a 10 day chronic immobilisation stress
paradigm within the mPFC that are opposite to what has been seen in the
amygdala.
An interesting observation about stress disorders reveals that often a
single exposure to stress can be sufficient to cause a delayed emergence
of disease phenotype. This ?temporal? build-up provides a window, after
exposure to stress, where it might be possible to intervene
pharmacologically, and reverse the onset of symptoms. In order to address
this question, I have standardised the Elevated Plus Maze, a behavioural
paradigm for rodent anxiety, to quantify the delayed increase in anxiety
like behaviour after an acute immobilisation stress protocol. This will
subsequently be followed by pharmacological interventions in future
experiments. <br> Understanding Pika diversity in the Himalaya </br><br>The taxonomic classification of Pikas (Family: Ochotonidae) is
complicated by their overlapping distributions, seasonal differences in
coloration within species, remarkable similarity in morphology between
species, occurrence in inaccessible regions and inadequate genetic data.
We sampled pikas in the Himalaya primarily in the state of Sikkim,
Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and two districts of Nepal, with the
objective to resolve taxonomic uncertainty and elucidate distribution
patterns. We used morphometrics and phylogenetic data to resolve taxonomic
uncertainties. In future research, we will use Pikas inhabiting different
elevational and latitudinal bands, as a model to understand if they
responded to past climatic fluctuation. <br> Critical period for Learning in Drosophila melanogaster </br><br>During development, there is a period of hightened sensitivity
to external stimuli, which is necessary for the acquisition of a certain
skill. And if the skill is not acquired during this time, it may be very
difficult or impossible for the animal to acquire the skill later. This
period of heightened sensitivity is called critical period. A critical
period is observed in learning of birdsong in male chaffinches,
imprinting on the mother in newly hatched geese, and in many other
contexts.
Previous studies have shown the existence of a critical period in
structural plasticity associated with odorant exposure (Sachse et. al.,
2008). I am studying the mechanisms of establishment of a critical period
in olfactory habitution (a form of non-associative learning) in
Drosophila. Results from initial experiments show that, when flies are
exposed to an odorant for 4 days starting immediately after eclosion
(hatching out of pupal case), they show structural changes in the areas of
the olfactory lobe responding to that odor. But these structural changes
are not observed in flies exposed to the odorant for the same duration
starting from the 2nd day after eclosion.
Next, I plan to find the mechanisms involved in the establishment of the
critical period in the Drosophila olfactory system, using genetic
manipulations which extend the duration of the critical period. <br> Understanding the folding/unfolding mechanism of
hyperthermophilic protein: A case study on Ctd-MK0293 </br><br>Small, single domain hyperthermophilic proteins have become
increasingly important as models for protein folding study. We have
investigated the folding & unfolding mechanism (equilibrium and kinetic)
of the hyperthermophilic protein Ctd-MK0293 (C-terminal domain of MK0293)
using multiple probes (far & near UV-CD, Fluorescence and NMR). This
protein is natively present in the archaeal methanogen Methanopyrus
Kandleri which survives in temperatures upto 110?C. We observed that
Ctd-MK0293 undergo cold denaturation above -40 ?C, in the absence of
chemical denaturants. This interesting property provides the unique
opportunity to explore experimentally the molecular mechanism of both the
hot and cold denaturation. In this AWS, I will present the
characterization of the folding & unfolding mechanism of Ctd-MK0293 using
multiple probes (far & near UV-CD, Fluorescence and NMR). <br> Differential Notch4 signaling in breast cancer cells </br><br>Notch signaling plays an indispensable role in regulating cell
fate and consequently, aberrant Notch activity has been reported in
cancer. Canonical Notch signaling proceeds through a series of proteolytic
cleavages, following ligand binding, resulting in release of the
Intracellular Domain of Notch (ICN). ICN translocates to the nucleus and
in a complex with RBPj&#954; and Mastermind-like (MAML) regulates
transcription of key target genes. Additionally, ligand and
transcription-independent functions of Notch have also been described. Of
the Notch receptors, Notch4 activity is up-regulated in a majority of
invasive breast cancerswith a strong co-relation between Notch4 expression
and triple-negative breast cancers1. Further Notch signaling has been
implicated in chemoresistance of cells, maintenance of self-renewal
property of cancer stem cells, epithelial to mesenchymal transition and
anchorage-independent growth of adherent cells2. However, the signaling
circuitry underlining these different cue-dependent responses mediated by
Notch4 has not been delineated.
I will present data demonstrating that endogenous Notch4 signaling to
proliferation is dependent on canonical Notch activity while Notch4-driven
resistance to anchorage-deprivation is a function of full length Notch4.
Further I will also provide evidence that while Notch4 drives survival and
resistance to select death stimuli, it also sensitizes cells to death via
TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand (TRAIL). Theseobservations highlight
the capability of Notch4 to elicit distinct signaling pathways under
different environmental cues and suggest thatwhile increased Notch4
activity might be oncogenic under certain contexts, it results in
sensitization of cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.

Stem Cells (MSCs). </br><br>Adult stem cells (ASCs) are tissue resident stem cells
responsible for tissue homeostasis and regeneration. In uninjured
tissues, ASCs exist in a non-proliferating, reversibly arrested cell
cycle state known as quiescence or G0.Quiescence is thoughtto preserve
stemness in ASCs by preventing precocious differentiation, resulting in
the maintenance of an undifferentiated pool of ASC throughout the life
span of the individual.
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are adult stem cells that can be isolated
from various post natal tissues such as bone marrow, adipose tissue,
heart, liver and lungs. In vitro, MSCs are self-renewing and can be
induced to differentiate into cells of three different lineages-fat, bone
and cartilage.Recent studies suggest that like HSCs and muscle stem cells,
a subpopulation of MSCs are also quiescent invivo. To date, most of what
we know about MSCs is based on in vitro expanded heterogeneous populations
and very little is known about MSCs in vivo.
Our aim is to understand the mechanisms regulating MSCs quiescence which
might help in elucidating biological role as well as identity of these
cells in vivo.Currently, one roadblock is the lack of exclusive MSC
markers, makingit difficult to purify quiescent MSCs. Therefore, ex-vivo
culture conditions that can regulate MSC cell cycle is an alternate
approach to study G0 and uncover new markers.
I will present my work showing that modulating cellular adhesion and
contractilityinduces G0 in culturedprimary human MSCs. Whole transcriptome
analysis of G0 MSCs reveals molecular signatures that might be involved in
regulating quiescence. Focusing on a receptor-type protein tyrosine
phosphatase, PTPRU, found in my screen as strongly induced in G0-MSCs, I
will present progress suggesting that PTPRU might be involved in
regulating MSC quiescence through the beta-catenin signaling pathway. <br> microRNA based gene therapy approach in hematopoietic system. </br><br>Small RNAs have been reported to be deregulated in many
cancers, and diseases but limited to their phenotype, especially rare
enough to be used as therapeutics. The promise of miRNA therapy is
perhaps greatest in cancer due to the apparent role of miRNAs as tumor
suppressors and oncogenes. MicroRNAs target multiple genes/signalling
pathways by mRNA degradation or translation inhibition of target
molecules, re-establishing the expression of a single miRNA to that of the
non-diseased tissue will produce a more pervasive therapeutic effect
compared to drugs that obey the one-drug-one-target paradigm.Current
challenges include delivery of synthetic oligonucleotides, stability, and
safety.
Drug resistance phenomenon in chronic myeloid leukemia is regulated by
poorly understood cell intrinsic and extrinsic signals. We identified
miR-182 in Imatinib treated CML cell line K562. In my recent work, I have
tried to understand the function of miR-182 by using LNA anti-miRs, and
CRISPR mediated knocking out of MIR-182. The ribose moiety of an LNA has
been modified with an extra bridge connecting the 2` oxygen, and 4`
carbon. The locked ribose conformation enhances base stacking and backbone
preorganization which significantly increases the hybridization properties
(melting temperature) of oligonucleotides. Here we show that miR-182
inhibition by LNA decreases the colony formation potential of K562 cells
in methyl-cellulose media cultured for 14 days. Anti-miR-182 transfected
cellsare also shown to be Imatinib sensitive compared with scramble
control cells.
 CRISPR is clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats
discovered in prokaryotes. A recent in vitro reconstitution of
the?Streptococcus pyogenes?type II CRISPR system demonstrated that crRNA
fused to a normally trans-encoded tracrRNA is sufficient to direct Cas9
protein to sequence-specifically cleave target DNA sequences matching the
crRNA. We designed the guide RNA to target human MIR-182 site
(Chr07q32.2). The off-target effects were calculated for individual
guideRNAs, and guideRNAs with minimum off-targets were chosen for
experiments. Further, we cloned these guide RNA blocks in desired vector,
and transfected HEK293T cells along with Cas9-GFP plasmid which makes
double strand cut at target site. We have nucleofected K562 cells with
same plasmid system to check the efficiency of knock-outs. I`ll present
preliminary data of CRIPSR knock-out of K562 cells in this AWS. <br> Effects of stress on astrocytes and its implications on neuronal
plasticity. </br><br>Majority of research on stress has focused on changes in
neuronal physiology for the observed stress induced phenotypes at the
systems and behavioural levels. Astrocytes on the other hand have received
considerably less attention, although they form the majority cell type in
absolute numbers in the central nervous system, as well as occupy a
crucial and versatile functional niche. We therefore aim to understand how
stress alters the structure and function of astrocytes, and how these
perturbations influence stress induced neuronal plasticity.
Chronic immobilization stress (CIS) is known to have contrasting effects
on the neurons of the hippocampus and the amygdala in terms of structural,
synaptic and intrinsic plasticity. We hypothesized that the divergent
effects of stress in the two regions also apply to astrocytes.
Investigations of the effect of stress on the number of Glial fibrilary
acidic protein (GFAP) positive astrocytes in the two brain regions
demonstrated a significant increase in the cell numbers in Basal Amygdala
(BLA). Further, in order to understand the effects of stress on astrocyte
morphology and astrocyte-neuron interactions, we are currently
standardizing intracellular dye filling of astrocytes in order to glean
high resolution information on single cell morphology.
Functionally, most of the synaptic and extra-synaptic glutamate reuptake
and recycling is done by glutamate transporters (GLT-1, GLAST) expressed
on the surface of astrocytes. Another aspect of my study focuses on
understanding how stress induced structural plasticity in the principle
neurons are modulated by pharmacologically potentiating the activity of
these glutamate transporters. <br> Probing the aggregation kinetics and conformational changes
during the conversion of native mouse prion protein 23-231 to worm-like
fibrils using a spectroscopic approach </br><br>Protein aggregation is a highly complex process often involving
significant conformationalchanges, passing via multiple intermediates and
pathways and eventually leading to a heterogeneousensemble of highly
structured amyloid fibrils or unstructured aggregates. Till date, high
resolutionstructures of amyloid fibrils have only been obtained from solid
state nuclear magnetic resonancespectroscopy (SSNMR) and X-ray
crystallography. Traditionally, kinetics of fibril formation has
beentracked by the fluorescence based Thioflavin T assay which, albeit
useful, provides little informationabout the intermediates or
conformational changes associated with fibril formation. While amyloid
fibrilsthemselves have been studied in great detail using a variety of
biophysical techniques, only recentlyhas the focus shifted towards
aggregation pathways and related on or off-pathway intermediates.Since
multiple pathways can lead to conformational diversity (commonly known as
the ?strain?phenomenon) in the final product, the amyloid fibril, it is
important to understand the mechanismsinvolved in protein aggregation.
 Prion proteins are composed of an alpha helix rich globular domain and
an intrinsically disordered N terminus with two N-linked glycosylation
sitesand a C terminal GPI anchor. They undergo significant
conformational changes on conversion fromthe alpha helix rich cellular
form (PrPc) to a beta sheet rich disease associated scrapie form
(PrPSc).What triggers this conformational change is not known, neither
is the cellular function of the protein.PrPSc is known to form
networks of amyloid fibrils which are deposited as plaques in the
brains ofdiseased animals suffering from a number of deadly
neurodegenerative diseases like scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform
encephalopathy in cattle, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans.
PrPc is knownto bind copper in vivo suggesting a role for it in copper
homeostasis. Recombinant prion protein has been employed as an
important model system for studying protein aggregation in vitro in
the recent past.
 Two very different in-vitro aggregation conditionsat pH 2.0 leading to
worm-like fibrils and pH 7.0 leading tostraight fibrils of the
recombinant mouse prion protein have been identified in the
laboratory.?In this AWS, I will discuss preliminary results obtained
from solution NMR and fluorescence, which have been used as
high-resolution probes to obtain molecular level information about the
aggregation pathway. The broad objectives of this work are (i) to
understand how the internal structure of the monomers is connected to
the external morphology of the oligomers and worm-like fibrils (ii) to
probethe long-range conformational changes accompanying the formation
of oligomers and worm-like fibrilsin real time. ? <br> Understanding the underlying biochemical and cellular mechanisms
of genetically caused cardiomyopathy </br><br>The most frequent causes of primary cardiomyopathies are
mutations in the genes encoding sarcomeric proteins. We are interested in
studying the Tropomyosin (Tm) mutations as it interacts with Myosin, Actin
and Troponins. I have chosen two Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)
mutations I172T and S215L, based on the clinical severity and location
along the Tm filament. Interaction of these mutations with the thick and
thin filaments was studied. Measurement of Ca2+ sensitivity by ATPase
assay indicated increased sensitivity. Regulatory complex conformational
change was also studied using florescent probes. Also, there was an
interesting correlation seen between the ATPase at maximum
Ca2+concentration and the change in Troponin confirmation. I have also
designed TALENs for Tropomyosin and beta-cardiac myosin heavy chain for in
vivo studies where we plan to use embryonic stem cells as well as
humanized mouse models. Our aim is to determine the biochemical and
cellular characteristics of these mutations so as to provide a rationale
for treatment of the cardiomyopathies. <br> miRNA mediated regulation of stem cell function and regeneration
in planaria. </br><br>In recent years, the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea has
emerged as a tractable model system to study stem cell biology and
regeneration. MicroRNAs are small RNA species that control gene expression
by modulating translational repression and mRNA stability and have been
implicated in the regulation of various cellular processes. Though recent
studies have identified several miRNAs in S. mediterranea, their
expression in neoblast sub-populations and during regeneration has not
been examined. Here, we identify several miRNAs whose expression is
enriched in different neoblast sub-populations and in regenerating tissue
at different time points in S.mediterranea. Some of these miRNAs were
enriched within 3 hrs post-amputation and may therefore play a role in
wound healing and/or neoblast migration. Our results also revealed miRNAs,
such as sme-miR-2d-3p and the sme-miR-124 family, whose expression is
enriched in the cephalic ganglia, that are also expressed in the brain
primordium during CNS regeneration. These results provide new insight into
the potential biological functions of miRNAs in neoblasts and regeneration
in planarians. <br> Phosphatidylinositol 5-phospahte 4-Kinase (PIP4K): Role in membrane
 turnover in Drosophila melanogaster </br><br>Phosphatidylinositol 5-phospahte 4-Kinase (PIP4K)
phosphorylates Phosphatidylinositol 5-phospahte(PI5P) to
Phosphatidylinositol 4,5- bisphospahte (PI(4,5)P2). PI5P is present in
extremely miniscule levels in vivo and cannot majorly contribute to
several hundred fold higher levels of PI(4,5)P2 at the plasma membrane.
This questions biochemical relevance of this enzyme. CG17471 encodes the
only PIP4K in Drosophila melanogaster (dPIP4K). A complete knock out of
dPIP4K called dPIP4K29 revealed elevated levels of PI5P, implying its
requirement in the maintenance of PI5P levels in vivo. Cellular
fractionation revealed the presence of dPIP4K on the plasma membrane and
several endomembrane compartments. (Gupta et. al, 2013). A priori, various
phosphoinositides have been implicated in the transport and trafficking of
different endomembrane compartments. I have used the adult Drosophila
photoreceptors as a model system to understand the cellular role for
dPIP4K. The maintenance adult photoreceptor neurons critically depends
membrane turnover events in response to light, the lack of it is one of
the causes of light induced retinal degeneration. Through my experiments
I could demonstrate an increased rate of rhabdomere membrane turnover
events in the dPIP4K29 photoreceptors during illumination. This was
associated with an increase in flux through early and late endosomal
compartments as well as autophagosomal compartments.
In order to understand the mechanism of increased membrane turn over in
dPIP4K29 , I performed endocytic uptake assay on primary cell cultures of
larval hemocytes from dPIP4K29 and knock down of PIP4K in S2R+ cells. I
will present recent findings providing better mechanistic insight into
these observations. <br> GENETICS OF ALZHEIMER?S DISEASE ? Identification of disease relevant
 variants </br><br>AD is a devastating neurodegenerative disease and currently
there is no known cure. Genetic variations play a major role as
disease-causing mutations have been identified in genes encoding the
A&#946; synthesis (PSEN1, PSEN2, APP) and lipid homeostasis (APOE)
pathways. However, these variants account for only 20-30% of the total
genetic risk with APOE accounting for most of this contribution. A large
number of familial cases do not harbor mutations in these genes and
several unidentified genes containing disease-causing mutations are
thought to exist. AD and other forms of dementia are a growing public
health problem in India. The current prevalence of AD in India is ~3.7
million but due to the rapid population growth and increased longevity, it
is estimated that by the year 2030 approximately 20% of the world?s
population aged 60 and above will be living in India. Identification of
genetic markers (causal/risk/protective) influencing disease manifestation
is critical. This information will provide the basis for developing a risk
profile for early pre-symptomatic diagnosis of high risk individuals, shed
light on the disease mechanism and allow effective preventive
interventions to be implemented.
We performed whole exome sequencing on 12 familial AD patients previously
screened negative for genes encoding the amyloid pathway. Variants were
filtered for segregating, conserved and functional rare variants
(MAF<0.1%) assuming autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Filtered loci
were examined for implication as AD candidate genes by comparing the data
to identified candidate genes from GWAS meta-analysis and biologically
relevant Alzheimer KEGG Pathway genes. This analysis resulted in
identification of several rare variants with potential role in AD
pathogenesis and will be presented in today?s talk. <br> Effects of atmospheric nutrient deposition on tropical dry forest
 tree seedling growth. </br><br>Tropical dry forests constitute India?s most wide spread and
extensive forest type. With its important role in maintaining
biodiversity and provisioning of services for humans, understanding the
trajectory of this mixed tree-grass ecosystem in the face of global
change drivers is critical. Atmospheric deposition of nutrients such as
nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) have been identified as important global
change agents. Being major plant nutrients, increases in N and P
availability through deposition have been demonstrated to cause
significant shifts in vegetation structure, diversity and community 
composition across a number of ecosystems globally. In tropical dry
forests increasing N and P availability could impact vegetation directly
through changes in tree recruitment, growth, biomass allocation and
susceptibility to disturbance agents such as fire, as well as, indirectly
via changes in the properties of the disturbance regime itself. Further,
the tree layer of this ecosystem can be divided into two functional
groups - N fixers and non-N fixers. With fundamentally different nutrient
requirements and acquisition strategies, differential responses to
increased N and P availability may be expected for the two functional
groups. Here I present preliminary results on the effect of N and P
addition on the above ground growth of tropical dry forest tree seedlings
from a recently concluded pot experiment and an ongoing field experiment. <br> Pollination ecology of *Clerodendrum viscosum* </br><br>Clerodendrum viscosum is a native shrub species of Western
Ghat. I am working on different aspects of pollination of this species.
How the interaction between different components of pollination and in
turn their interaction with underlying ecological components determining
plant?s female reproductive success and how top-down effects are
modulating the outcome is my research topic. To explore these things in
detail I need to know the basic pollination biology of that species. I am
working on that too. <br> Regulation of phototransduction and PI(4,5)P2 turnover in
Drosophila photoreceptors by septins. </br><br>The septin family of proteins was first discovered in the
budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and later found to be present in
fungi, flies, amphibian and mammals. The name septin refers to the
involvement of these proteins in cytokinesis and septum formation. Septins
contain a nucleotide-binding sequence homologous to the consensus
sequences of the GTPase super family. Drosophila genome encodes five
septin genes. Several studies on septins show its role in cytokinesis.
However the function of these proteins in mature neurons is not clear.
In our model system where we study receptor mediated phototransduction in
Drosophila photoreceptors, we have found experimental evidence supporting
the existence of distinct pools of lipid molecules (PIP2) in these cells.
However the mechanism by which those pools are kept separate from mixing
up is not clear. The existing published literatures on the role of septins
as a diffusion barrier make these proteins an interesting candidate
molecule.
To study the role of septins in phototransduction, we started with one of
the Drosophila septins, pnut. pnut knockdown showed an increase in light
sensitivity as evident from electroretinogram recordings, indicating that
pnut controls light response in adult photoreceptors. We also found that
knocking down pnut cause increased PIP2 turnover rate in photoreceptor
cells, overexpression of pnut shows delay in this process. These results
collectively suggest for its potential role in lipid turnover. <br> Neurophysiological changes triggered by acute stress in the amygdala </br><br>Stress modulates structure and function of neurons in the
amygdala. A single episode of stress (acute stress) leads to a delayed
onset of both anxiety like behaviour and an increase in spine density in
the amygdala. We investigated the neuronal correlates of these changes
using whole cell patch clamp recordings from projection neurons in the
Lateral Amygdala(LA). We found that acute stress led to an increase in
basal excitatory transmission in the LA. This is partly due to an increase
in the probability of excitatory neurotransmitter release at presynaptic
thalamic inputs. We show that NMDA receptor mediated activity in the
amygdala during stress is critical for inducing these changes. We have
also investigated how these cellular changes affect Long Term Potentiation
(LTP) in the amygdala, which is considered to be the cellular mechanism of
fear learning.
Endocannabinoids are retrograde signalling molecules whose primary
function is to gate neurotransmitter release. Since we observed a change
in the probability of neurotransmitter release due to acute stress, we
hypothesized that endocannabinoids might be a key player in regulating
this. Consistent with the hypothesis, we find that pharmacologically
increasing the levels of endocannabinoids can reverse some of the changes
due to acute stress. In a parallel study, we find that presence of
elevated levels of stress hormone corticosterone at the time of acute
stress confers protection against the delayed enhancing effect of stress
on basal excitatory transmission. <br> Genomic Analysis Reveals Distinct Concentration-Dependent
Evolutionary Trajectories for Antibiotic Resistance in Escherichia coli </br><br>Evolution of bacteria under sublethal concentrations of
antibiotics represents a trade-off between growth and resistance to the
antibiotic. To understand this trade-off we performed in vitro evolution
of laboratory E. coli under sublethal concentrations of the aminoglycoside
kanamycin over short time durations. We report that fixation of
less-costly kanamycin-resistant mutants occurred earlier in populations
growing at lower sublethal concentration of the antibiotic, when compared
to those growing at higher sublethal concentrations; in the latter,
resistant mutants with a significant growth defect persisted for longer.
Using deep sequencing, we identified kanamycin resistance-conferring
mutations, which were costly or not in terms of growth in the absence of
the antibiotic. Multiple mutations in the C-terminal end of domain IV of
the translation elongation factor EF-G provided low-cost resistance to
kanamycin. Despite targeting the same or adjacent residues of the protein,
these mutants differed from each other in the levels of resistance they
provided. Analysis of one of these mutations showed that it has little
defect in growth or in synthesis of GFP from an inducible plasmid in the
absence of the antibiotic. A second class of mutations, recovered only
during evolution in higher sub-lethal concentrations of the antibiotic,
deleted the C-terminal end of the ATP synthase shaft. This mutation
confers basal-level resistance to kanamycin, while showing a strong growth
defect in the absence of the antibiotic. In conclusion, the early dynamics
of the development of resistance to an aminoglycoside antibiotic is
dependent on the levels of stress (concentration) imposed by the
antibiotic, with the evolution of less-costly variants only a matter of
time. <br> Effects of elevation on endosymbiont communities in an aphid
species complex </br><br>Bacterial endosymbionts often have an important impact upon the
ecology of their insect hosts. For instance, in aphids, the ability to
survive and reproduce at high temperatures is constrained by thermal
sensitivity of the obligate endosymbiont, Buchnera aphidicola. Facultative
endosymbionts, such as Serratia symbiotica and Hamiltonella defensa, can
promote heat tolerance in some aphid species, and are thus expected to
increase in frequency under high temperature conditions. However, very few
studies have investigated changes in endosymbiont communities across a
temperature gradient in natural aphid populations. In this study, 454
amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA sequences was used to examine
the species composition and diversity of endosymbiont communities within
and among four related aphid species which occur across an elevation
gradient in the Eastern Himalayas. Whilst two of the aphid species exist
across a broad elevation gradient, one is restricted to relatively low
elevations (high temperatures) and the other is a high elevation (low
temperature) specialist. I will discuss my preliminary analyses comparing
the endosymbiont communities in these species. <br> Semaphorins instruct the development of functional motor neuron
connectivity in the Drosophila walking circuit </br><br>An animal gathers sensory cues, integrates this information
with the final outcome an appropriate motor behavior. Motoneurons
represent key elements that provide the final common path of convergence
of processed information in neural networks. We are studying the mechanism
underlying the development of one form of motor output, walking circuit in
adult Drosophila.
Walking is coordinated movement that is controlled by motoneurons that
innervate muscles of the leg. For their correct function, motoneurons must
acquire specific cellular architectures during development such that their
input domains, usually manifest as dendrites, receive connections from
appropriate premotor neurons, and their axonal output domains make
connections to correct target muscles. Motoneurons in adult flies are
organized as a myotopic map where the dendritic arborization of a
particular motor neuron in the central nervous system is related to the
axonal innervations in the leg muscles (Brierley et al 2009, 2011). The
contribution of molecular neuronal guidance cues, regulated usually by
signaling systems, to the development of specific leg motor neuron
architecture is poorly understood.
Semaphorins are a large family of both trans-membrane and secreted
glycoproteins known to be involved in axon guidance in vertebrates and
invertebrates. We have investigated the role of Semaphorin signaling
system in the development of the functional leg-myotopic map. The temporal
expression of these molecules in neurons, muscles and glia suggest that
these could play role in the development of the walking circuit. We
demonstrate abnormal walking pattern, axon-defasciculation defects and
defects in dendritic arborization upon RNAi- mediated Semaphorin knockdown
and gain of function in motor neurons. Our data suggests that the cross
talk between glia, motor neurons and muscles imposes topographic order and
proper positioning of the motor neurons in the central nervous system and
the periphery so that the functional circuit is developed. <br> The folding mechanism of E. Coli RNase H is determined by a
"specifically" packed core region </br><br>Generally proteins with similar structure fold by a similar
mechanism. However, experimental studies show that E.coli and HIV RNase H
fold via different kinetic intermediates. RNase H has two structural
regions namely, ?core? and ?periphery?. The E.coli intermediate involves
formation of only the core region. HIV RNase H domain is structurally
similar but its kinetic intermediate involves the formation of core as
well as major part of the periphery (except an alpha helix). We examined
the folding of these two proteins using molecular dynamics simulations of
C-alpha structure based models (SBMs), to test whether our models capture
the differences in folding mechanism. We find that by scaling the default
homogenous contact energies by all atom interactions in the respective
native contacts, the SBM predicts the folding mechanism in better
agreement with experiments for both proteins. The heterogeneous contact
energies arise as a result of side chain packing interactions. We find
that stabilization due to the side chain packing in the core region in
E.coli is higher than peripheral region and hence it folds first. On the
other hand, the relative contact energies of core and periphery in HIV
RNase H are similar and it folds directly to the intermediate where core
and periphery are folded except for last helix. We predict that if the
relative energies of both the regions in RNase H are similar, it will
entirely fold from the periphery. Currently we are examining the folding
of RNase H from other organisms and intend to compare the above results
with them. <br> Structural correlates of fear memory in the amygdala </br><br>The brain is highly plastic and capable of experience
dependent rewiring*. The central dogma in the learning and memory field is
that such experience induced changes in the brain are stored at the level
of the synapses, which are the contact point between neurons. These
neurons can undergo physiological plasticity (changes in the strength of
the synapse) and structural plasticity (changes in neuronal morphology)
which modulates the behavior of the organism. The amygdala, which is the
emotional centre of the brain, is required for the acquisition and storage
of cued fear memories. Various reports have established that synaptic
plasticity in the lateral amygdala (LA) accompany cued fear memory
formation. I am interested
in understanding the structural correlates underlying fear learning in the
lateral amygdala.
For elucidating the structural changes, rats were fear conditioned (a
paradigm where the animal learns to associate a neutral stimulus i.e.
tone, with an aversive stimulus i.e. foot-shock). Next day these rats were
either subjected to the fear memory recall or were sacrificed to collect
their
brain. These brains were then subjected to modified Golgi cox staining to
observe the spine density changes in response to fear conditioning. In my
AWS I will be presenting behavioral data from rats that were subjected to
auditory fear conditioning. Next, I will also discuss the changes in spine
density from a separate set of fear conditioned animals. <br> PKD, phosphoinositides: potential role in wing venation patterning </br><br>Adult wing development from imaginal discs is regulated by
signalling via morphogens. Intracellular transport mechanisms are likely
to be important not only for morphogen secretion but also for the response
of target cells in the wing disc to these molecules. Lipids are central
players in cellular transport not only as inert cargo containers but also
in their capacity to modulate transport in developing cells.
Phosphoinositides, are such a class signalling lipids.
Protein kinase D (PKD) is described as a regulator of secretory events at
the trans-Golgi (TGN) controlling transport to distinct plasma membrane
domains. In vitro, PKD has been shown to regulate the activity of multiple
phosphoinositide kinases; phosphoinositides themselves have been shown to
regulate transport at the TGN. Previously I had shown that modulating PKD
activity gives rise to defect in wing venation. I had also presented data
regarding the reported phosphoinositide kinase (PIP) targets of PKD.
I will present experimental data on the further analysis of PIP kinase
function and morphogen signalling as I try to map the wing vein loss
phenotype to the pathway(s) that are affected to give rise to anterior
cross vein loss. <br> Role of DEAD box helicase RNA binding proteins in planarian
regeneration and homeostasis </br><br>Although all organisms display the ability to regenerate to
varying extents, planarians steal the show - even the smallest fragment
can regenerate into an entire animal.Planarian regeneration depends on the
presence and precise regulation of pluripotent adult somatic stem
cells,neoblasts, which differentiate to replace cells during regular
homeostasis or regeneration. However, the detailed molecular mechanism by
which these unique cells differentiate into specific cell types is not
completely understood. Recent transcriptome analysis at our lab showed
enrichment of several genes encoding for RNA binding proteins in neoblast
population suggesting the role of post transcriptional regulation in
controlling the stem cell function. RBPs interact with nascent RNA
transcripts in order to carry out important functions such as splicing,
nuclear export, stability and translation so that proteins are efficiently
produced to meet the need of the cell.Thus, an understanding of the
function of RBPs is crucial, to highlight their central role in gene
expression. Our study involves characterizing the role of dead box
helicase proteins enriched in neoblasts in planarian regeneration. We
found Smed DDX24 plays an important role in formation of germline and
photoreceptors but not neoblast proliferation. Thus, it might be
specifically affecting differentiation of the common progenitor involved
in formation of these lineages. <br> Signalling at the serotonin 2A receptor. </br><br>Serotonin is an important neurotransmitter and neuromodulator
and is implicated in various psychological disorders such as
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression etc. The serotonin 2A
receptor is an important effector molecule for the serotonergic system and
a GPCR. It has also previously been shown that serotonin 2A receptor is
quite promiscuous and can be activated by a variety of molecules including
endogenous amines (I. Raote Unpublished data, B. Blough et al 2014, S.
Bhattacharyya et al 2006) as well as synthesized molecules such as DOI,
lisurideetc. I will discuss some of my data regarding the signalling via
this receptor when activated by different endogenous amines. A lot of
theantipsychotic and antidepressant drugs that target 5-HT2A receptor have
severe side-effects and hence the need to search for newer molecules. I
will be presenting data about a project done in collaboration with Prof
Sowdhamini?s lab in which I tested some molecules selected by
bioinformatics prediction methods for their effect at the 5HT2A receptor,
using intracellular calcium release assay.
However, most of the studies with serotonin 2A receptor have been done in
HEK293 cells. There is a need for a system in which 5HT2A receptor is
expressed endogenously in a neuronal background. I will also discuss my
work regarding developing a system to study the serotonin 2A receptorin a
neuronal background. To this end I am establishing differentiated neuronal
culturesfromneurospheres of mice(both wildtype as well as 5-HT2AR
knock-out) and human embryonic stem cell derived neural stem cells as well
as from patient derived IPSCs. <br> Regulation of cellular growth and larval development by
phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate-4-kinase (PIP4K) in Drosophila </br><br>Insulin-like Signaling (IS) is an important signaling pathway
that coordinates the growth of different organs/tissues during the
development of Drosophila larvae. Phosphoinostides (PI), a group of low
abundance phospholipids, are key cellular signaling intermediates
downstream of Insulin receptor activation. The levels and localization of
these PI are tightly regulated by PI-kinases and phosphatases. In this
context, we have identified the activity of
phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate-4-kinase (PIP4K) as a regulator of larval
growth and development in Drosophila.
PIP4K is encoded by a single gene in the Drosophila genome. Homozygous
knockout for this enzyme (dPIP4K29) is viable. However, when compared to
controls, the dPIP4K29 larvae weigh less and show a delay in
development, associated with a decrease in cell size. Previous work from
the lab has demonstrated that these phenotypes are linked to decreased
signalling output via the TOR complexes, the central node in cellular
growth control. Our experiments now suggest that the activity of
Drosophila PIP4K is in fact required upstream of TOR complexes, probably
at the level of insulin receptor activation and that the loss of PIP4K
leads to altered sensitivity towards insulin. <br> Critical role of SOCE in Dopaminergic neurons for flight of
Drosophila. </br><br>Changes in cellular levels of Calcium ion (Ca2+) impact
multiple aspects of cellular life. In the neuronal context, Ca2+ can
determine the morphology of neuronal circuits, direction of growth cones,
dendritic development, apoptosis, phagocytosis and synaptogenesis. There
are many known components of the ?Calcium Tool kit? which helps in
maintaining calcium homeostasis in cells. I am interested in studying
components of SOCE (Store Operated Calcium Entry) dSTIM and dOrai.
To study the role of SOCE in neurons in context of Drosophila flight, we
have generated dominant negative form of dOrai(E180A). Over expression of
E180A in dopaminergic neurons gave reduced SOCE in primary neuronal
culture and 100% flight defect in adult Drosophia. To find out the stage
of Drosophila life cycle from which the flight phenotype is coming we have
used TARGET system. 100% flight defect was obtained on over expressing
E180A in dopaminergic neurons at pupal stage. When we reduced SOCE in
adults then we got increased amount of flight defect with increasing time
of over expression of E180A. These results suggested that the SOCE is
necessary in dopaminergic neurons at pupal and adult stage for flight of
Drosophila. I will also show some resultswhich will show howpupal and
adult flight phenotype is different. <br> Interaction of the full length mouse prion protein with the
biological membranes; effects on membrane permeability </br><br>Prion diseases are a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders
which affect animals and humans. It is widely accepted that the conversion
of native monomeric cellular prion protein (PrP^C ) to an aggregated
oligomeric form (PrP^Sc ) elicits the pathological features in these
diseases. It has been proposed that direct interaction between PrP and
lipid membrane, apart from the GPI-anchor, might play a critical role in
the PrP^Sc formation. Peptides derived from the PrP have been shown to
interact with lipid membrane and many of these peptides elicit cell
toxicity by perturbing the ionic balance inside the cell. Our study shows
that GPI- anchor less full length mouse prion protein (moPrP) bind to
lipid membrane and causes calcium release from the lipid vesicles.
Additionally, moPrP forms a cation selective channel which allows the
transit of only potassium and calcium ions. Also, it is observed that the
exogenous addition of moPrP into HEK 293T cells induces an increase
intracellular calcium level. Importantly, the dynamic increase of the
intracellular calcium level follows a pattern which is similar to the
typical calcium signaling. This observation suggests that prion protein is
not only able to form ion channels on the membrane but could also activate
calcium signaling through a group of receptor/s which is presently
unknown. Perhaps, this combination of ion channel formation and signaling
activity of moPrP might be sufficient to trigger the apoptotic pathways
through the discharge of cellular membrane potential, specifically,
mediated by the calcium influx. <br> Investigating the role of PAI1 in fibrosis </br><br>Fibrosis is a pathological condition characterised by excessive
secretion of extracellular matrix components. This disease condition is
the result of a complex cross talk between activated fibroblasts,
sprouting angiogenesis, blood vessel defects and inflammation. Experiments
done on the fibrotic disease model in our lab have shown that a number of
candidate molecules including the Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1 (PAI1)
may play a role in the establishment of this condition. However the exact
mechanism by which they act is unknown. PAI1 has been implicated to
inhibit collagen degradation via inactivation of MMPs and is also known to
be involved in inflammatory responses against gram negative bacteria.
Preliminary experiments done in the lab suggest that it also has a role in
fibroblast activation, increasing collagen secretion and in mast cell
infiltration. I will elucidate the molecular mechanism by which PAI1
regulates collagen secretion as well as its role in the inflammatory
response with respect to mast cells. <br> : Investigating the origin of cranial mesoderm and neural crest
during vertebrate evolution </br><br>Acquisition of novel embryonic cell types has been the key to
vertebrate evolution. Neural crest, cranial mesoderm and ectodermal
placodes are the embryonic innovations that contribute to the development
of ?new head? of the vertebrates.While the Neural crest and ectodermal
placodes are known to be evolutionarily novel, evolutionary origin of
cranial mesoderm is still controversial. We show that cranial mesoderm
develops successfully in Tbx6 null mouse embryos using key muscle
developmental markers such as Twist1, MyoDandMyf5. This demonstrates
thatcranial mesodermdevelopmentis independent of Tbx6, akey upstream
mesoderm specification factor. This supports our hypothesis that trunk and
cranial mesoderm developmental program are divergent in vertebrates.
Furthermore, the investigation of mesoderm development program in
Amphioxus, a cephalochordate, would reveal the evolutionary origin of
cranial mesoderm.
Another interest in the lab is to study the evolutionary origin of cranial
neural crest (CNC). I am particularly interested in identification of
micro-RNAs involved in acquisition of ectomesenchymal potential by CNC,
which is believed to be the last acquired common property of the neural
crest in the vertebrates. miRNAs are of special interest because of their
known role in animal evolution. During animal evolution acquisition of new
family of miRNAs is often linked to major change in the body plan.
Therefore here we hypothesize that vertebrate specific miRNAs are
responsible for acquisition of cranial neural crest in vertebrates. <br> Comparative study of Go&#773; model with incorporation of non
native hydrophobic and charged interactions on Chymotrypsin Inhibitor
2(CI2) and PI3K-SH3 domain. </br><br>Natural protein sequences are minimally frustrated and all
interactions present in the native state are strong enough to drive
folding. This is the basis for structure based models (Go&#773; like
models). Hence, all nonnative interactions in these models are repulsive.
Go&#773; models with C&#945; coarse graining have been shown to capture
the folding pathway of two state folding proteins and also proteins which
fold through the formation of intermediates. It has been experimentally
and computationally verified that presence of certain nonnative
hydrophobic interactions can accelerate the folding rate (eg. Fyn SH3
domain). It has also been demonstrated that native and nonnative charged
interactions play an important role in the kinetics of folding. Hence, the
current study tries to incorporate both nonnative hydrophobic and native
as well as non-native charged interactions in the standard Go&#773; 
model to study the folding of CI2 and PI3K-SH3. The folding pathway for
both the proteins remains largely unaffected upon the inclusion of these
nonnative interactions. <br> Characterization of auts2 genes in zebrafish </br><br>The autism susceptibility candidate 2 (AUTS2) gene is
associated with multiple neurological diseases. AUTS2 has been shown to be
disrupted in individuals with autism spectrum disorders, both in coding
and noncoding sequences. However, its function remains largely unknown. We
have characterized zebrafish orthologue of human AUTS2 gene. In our study,
we have identified several splice variants of auts2a and discribed its
expression pattern during zebrafish development. We have also isolated a
paralogue gene, auts2b. In contrast to ubiquitously expressed auts2a,
auts2b is predominantly expressed in the developing central nervous
system. We have used transcription activator-like effector nucleases
(TALEN) to target auts2 genes and demonstrated locus-specific somatic
mutations. To dissect the functional role of auts2a and auts2b during
development and in adult, we plan to induce inherited mutations in both
auts2 genes by using TALEN system. In my presentation I will discuss our
current progress and future prospects in the understanding auts2 function. <br> Immunity in aging: An evolutionary ecological perspective </br><br>In recent years, increasing applications of ecological and
evolutionary concepts to deeper understanding of immune response has
unfolded a range of limiting factors for immune function such as fitness
cost, optimality in immunity, sex differences. Ecological factors such as
age, sex or mating status can be of particular interest in understanding
causes and consequences of variation in immunity within- and
across-populations. Evolutionary ecological study of immune response thus
defines a huge field and a wide range of issues and areas are yet to be
addressed. Along this line, presently one of my major academic interests
is to understand the aging of immune response (Immunosenescnence). Using
the red flour beetle /Tribolium castaneum/ as a model system we found that
mating status and age interact to affect antibacterial activity, such that
it improved with age in virgin males and females but not in mated
individuals. Older beetles had a higher phenoloxidase activity relative to
younger beetles. An important question here that remains to be answered
is: does this improved immunity of older beetles translate into higher
probability of survival when infected? Our data clearly suggested that
aging reduced the ability to survive bacterial infection irrespective of
the mating status. It thus appears thatby and large, immunity alone does
not explain the fitness- post-infection survivorship with age. To fill the
gap, we will beinvestigating the possible role of age-specific tolerance
(as opposed to resistance) to infection and incidence of immuno pathology.
We will test ifolder individuals succumbed to infection due to immuno
pathological consequences even if they improved or retained their ability
to fight bacterial infection with age. In addition to innate immune
function (internal defense) in aging beetles, we also addressed
theantimicrobial activity by external secretion (outside the body) of
defensive compounds (external defense) inthe context of aging. Ourresults
suggested a complex interaction between age and sex in determining the
efficacy of external defense. To find a link between internal and external
defense, we tested if infection-induced internal immune function imposes a
substantial cost on individuals, affecting their external defense. We
found a contrasting effect of bacterial infection on external defense in
females in an age- and mating status-specific manner. Taken together, the
present study highlights a complex scenario of immunosenescence which I
will discuss both in the context of current progress and future plans. <br> Nonlinear Elasticity of Muscle and Its Role in Motor Control of
Postural Stability </br><br>Humans readily engage in tasks using their hands that require
complex dexterous manipulation. However, at times fingers can buckle
during contact, compromising manipulation and force generation. We ask if
maximal finger contact forces are determined by limitations in muscular
force production or by postural instabilities. We construct a mathematical
model to explore the stability of index finger posture during maximal
vertical force production on a horizontal surface. Our model shows that
activation patterns of muscles which lead to end point forces that are
larger than what is experimentally observed, but gives rise to
destabilizing joint stiffnesses values. Thus our model predicts that
artificially stabilizing finger posture should increase the magnitude of
maximum fingertip force. We test this theoretical prediction by
experiments where subjects were asked to produce maximal force in vertical
direction from their fingertip upon the load cell in presence and absence
of a finger supporting splint. The force production capability as well as
surface EMG recordings from finger muscles showed marked increase in
trials where splint was present as compared to trials where there was none
(Force -> 68%+-34%, EMG -> 78%+-71%). This is a clear demonstration of the
claim that fingertip forces are not limited solely by muscular strength
but rely heavily on implementation of stable posture. Our model also shows
that the minimum joint stiffness needed to maintain postural stability
scales nearly linearly with the magnitude of the contact force, a
relationship mirrored in biology by skeletal muscles; perhaps suggesting a
role for the nonlinear elasticity of muscle. <br> : Deciphering the mechanism of beta-catenin-independent Tcf/Lef1
target gene activation in quiescence </br><br>Quiescent satellite stem cells in normal adult muscle enter a
proliferative phase in response to muscle injury, leading to repair of
damaged muscle fibers. During regeneration, some satellite cells also
return to quiescence to replenish the progenitor population, allowing
further rounds of repair. Thus, quiescence or G0 is a critical phase in
adult stem cell function. Signaling pathways that regulate induction
and/or maintenance of quiescence in satellite cells are not well
understood. To study the molecular mechanism involved in quiescence we use
a culture model in which skeletal muscle myoblasts (C2C12) are reversibly
arrested in G0. Previous reports from our lab showed that quiescent
myoblasts display a strong transcriptional activation of the canonical Wnt
pathway including ectopic reporters and endogenous target genes. These
studies implicated both TCF/LEF transcription factor(s) and beta-catenin
transcriptional co-activator mediated target gene activation. Over the
past year, directed perturbation of different components of the
Wnt-beta-catenin-TCF pathway has led to a re-evaluation of beta-catenin?s
role. For example, perturbations of beta-catenin do not affect
trans-activation mediated by TCF/LEF in G0. My results suggest the
presence of an alternative pathway, which may bypass the Wnt-beta-catenin
pathway leading to the observed transcriptional activation mediated by
TCF/LEF. Preliminary experiments to investigate this mechanism indicate
that the TGF-beta pathway plays a role in this TCF/LEF-mediated
transcriptional activation, independent of beta-catenin. <br> Speciation and biogeography of the Papilio Swallowtail
Butterflies of the Indo-Australian Region </br><br>Tropical forests of the Indo-Australian region are known for
their high diversity and endemism from the time of Wallace?s explorations
in the area in the nineteenth century. Patterns of high species diversity
and endemism have been shown to be influenced by heterogeneity in
topography, climate and ecological processes. However, underlying
processes that drive these observed patterns continue to baffle
biogeographers. One of the interesting groups of animals are the
Swallowtail butterflies belonging to genus Papilio (Sub-genus:
Menalaides). The sub-genus Menalaidesis represented by ca. 50 species and
200 subspecies and it exhibits Batesian mimicry that manifests in
sex-specific and polymorphic forms. In this project, we aim to study the
interplay of geographical and ecological processes and their influence on
speciation and diversification in Papilio (Menelaides) swallowtail
butterflies.
To study speciation in Menalaides, we used 1) a phylogenetic framework to
reconstruct the evolutionary history of this group, and 2) historical
biogeographical methods and wing colour pattern evolution to assess the
role of geological and ecological processes respectively on the speciation
patterns and processes. We have sequenced four mitochondrial markers (COI,
COII, tRNA-leucine and 16S) and 2 nuclear markers (EF-1alpha and wingless)
for 46 species and multiple subspecies (~200 individuals) and used
Bayesian and Likelihood approaches to reconstruct phylogenetic
relationships. We delineated Menelaides as a monophyletic group by
revising subgenus assignment of the demolion-antonio-noblei species group.
Further, we delimited species within Menelaides using a multi-gene
sequence data in a coalescent and Bayesian framework (*BEAST, bGMYC and
bPTP). The results suggested presence of 40 putative species within
Menelaides, with ten potentially new distinct species across species
groups. Biogeographically isolated and morphologically very distinct
species were nested within larger memnon, and aegeus species groups,
suggesting complex speciation patterns in this region. We also identified
nine clades of what are currently considered to be subspecies of polytes,
helenus and fuscus, which are potentially distinct species that have
diversified largely in allopatry on the isolated island groups. Divergence
time estimation using secondary calibrations in Bayesian framework
suggested that Menelaides started diversifying in the Miocene around 14?5
mya. We will now use a species time tree produced here to integrate
biogeographic and speciation analyses along with wing colour pattern
element matrix to understand relative roles of geographic processes and
ecological interactions driving speciation of the Indo-Australian Papilio
(Menelaides) swallowtails. Furthermore, a conceptual framework developed
during this study will be useful for comparative studies in the future. <br> The role of microRNA mediated regulation in modulating
cytoskeletal arrangements and its influence on neurite growth and spine
formation. </br><br>Activity mediated translational regulation is an important
mechanism by which neurite growth, development and synaptic plasticity are
modulated.The neurons are having highly elaborate structural morphologies
which are correlated with their function.The physical properties of
neurons like neurite length, dendritic patterning, spine density, spine
shape, etc influences the processing of information within them. It has
been shown that neuronal morphology changes in response to external cues
like trophic factors and neurotransmitters and many of these responses are
protein synthesis dependent. The important proteins which are regulated in
this manner include the actin modulators in the Rho-GTPase pathway. Recent
studies suggest the role of microRNAs in this translational regulation. I
am investigating the role of microRNA mediated translational regulation of
actin cytoskeletal modulators such as LimK1, Cofilin1, Kalirin-7 and
Arp2/3. I am using primary neuronal culture as my model system. I am
studying whether there is change in the translation levels of these
candidates in response to neuronal activity and will try to identify and
characterize the microRNAs involved in this process, and explore how this
mechanism is important in regulating neurite growth and spine formation. <br> Developing an antibacterial 'silverized-graphene matrix' for
scar-free wound healing </br><br>Adult skin wound healing is a complex and well-orchestrated
process spurred by attendant inflammation that leads to wound closure with
scar formation. Formation of scars during healing of wounds including
surgical procedures is an unwanted outcome. Hence, developing innovative
approaches to achieve scar-free wound healing is an unmet
cosmeticandclinical (during myocardial infarction)need. Thus far, there
are no effective strategies available to prevent scar
formation.Interestingly, although inflammatory cells are intimately
involved in the regulation and progression of normal adult wound healing,
several lines of evidence suggest that the depletion of one or more of the
inflammatory cell types can have a positive outcome on the closure of
thewound, leading to a scar-free wound healing. A wound by disturbation of
tissue homeostasis or infection with foreign bodies can stimulate an
inflammatory reaction. Thus, we aim to develop a material that could be
used as a physical barrier to prevent external infection and impart
antibacterial efficacy to reduce PAMP-induced inflammation that
collectively may lead to scar-free wound healing. Herein, I developed a
graphene oxide-silver ion based composite antibacterial material which on
applicationto the wound site will attract less inflammatory cells like
neutrophils, macrophages and mast cells,thus leading to a more controlled
wound healing and reduced scar formation. Initial results show that
efficient antibacterial property of the graphene oxide-silver ion material
leading to a cleaner wound healing with reduced scar formation in female
BL6 mice. <br> Regulation of pri-miR-17-92a Processing </br><br>MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small non-coding RNAs that control
 gene expression either by RNA transcript degradation or
translational repression. miRNAs are involved in nearly all
cellular processes and hence their expression is highly regulated
in spatio-temporal manner both transcriptionally and
post-transcriptionally. This regulation is crucial, as alteration
of miRNA expression has been linked to human diseases, including several
cancers. How miRNAs achieve this regulation is largely unknown. miRNAs
which are on polycistronic transcripts represent a more complex case
where individual miRNAs from a cluster are processed differentially in
spite of being co-transcribed. To investigate the regulatory mechanisms
underlying these differential regulations, we chose the long
polycistronic primary miRNA transcript, pri-miR-17-92a that contains
six miRNAs with divergent functions. The six miRNA hairpins on
this cluster are differentially processed to produce varying
amounts of the resultant mature miRNAs. Their expression differs
based on the type of tissues and developmental stages. How this is
achieved is not known.
Our lab has hypothesized that these long non-coding RNA transcripts might
act as scaffolds that self-orchestrate the binding of multiple proteins,
where the binding of one protein on the RNA could causes a structural
remodeling of the RNA. The binding of protein in turn either exposes a
cryptic binding site or creates a new binding motif for the next protein
in the cascade. Thus the orchestrated remodeling might bring about
differential regulation of the miRNAs. <br> Mechanosensory and visual feedback controls antennal position in
flying honey bees </br><br>Flying insects receive sensory inputs from multiple
modalities during the course of their flight. Reliance on any one modality
alone could give wrong information to the insect in flight. Hence a
comparison of inputs coming into the flight machinery will give the insect
an unambiguous feedback about the environment. These inputs also come in
at different time scales. Mechanosensory feedback comes to the insect on a
wing stroke to wing stroke basis and visual feedback comes to the insect
in a couple of wing strokes. Studies have looked at the role of how these
two modalities independently affect flight but the role of these two cues
together in flight is not very clear. We looked at how these two
modalities affect antennal positioning in the European honey bee Apis
mellifera sp. Our results show that air flow and optic flow cues affect
antennal positioning in opposite ways. When provided in combination, these
two cues maintain a set antennal position. Thus the two cues work
together to maintain antennae in a state of dynamic equilibrium in the
range that we have conducted our experiments in. <br> Integrin signaling mediated re-organization of cell membrane
components </br><br>The plasma membrane of the living cell acts as an interface
between the cell and its external milieu. It serves as a dynamic conduit
for information transduction and response. It has been proposed that the
regulated lateral segregation of plasma membrane associated molecules into
distinct domains help in coordinating various signal transduction
functions. Previous work from our laboratory and others has shown that
proteins such as the outer leaflet GPI-anchored proteins, the inner
leaflet Ras proteins and several glycolipids form dynamically reorganizing
domains consisting of nanometer sized clusters [1].These passive molecular
arrangements are a consequence of the local dynamics and organization of
cortical actin filaments[2]. In contrast, we had proposed that signaling
receptors could actively regulate the composition of the membrane in their
vicinity by controlling the actin dynamics. Integrins,are prime candidates
for such an?Active particle?. They represent a family of hetero-dimeric
trans-membrane receptors that link extracellular ligands to a multitude of
signaling and structural molecules [3]. Although previous experiments have
reported that the zones of integrin activation are enriched in lipid-raft
like elements[4,5], the molecular mechanism as well as the physiological
relevance of creating such domains has not been explored.
I will present our understanding of the molecular machinery that regulates
the dynamics of short actin filaments. These filaments are implicated in
the creation of localized asters that leads to the active focusing of cell
surface molecules and the generation of lipid domains. Using the technique
of homo-FRET based fluorescence emission anisotropy, I find that the
engagement of Integrins that bind the extracellular matrix ligand
fibronectin, results in the enrichment of GPI-anchored proteins clusters
in the vicinity of the activated receptor. These results suggest that
Integrin receptors may fine-tune membrane organization by exploiting the
mechanism regulating the dynamic cortical actin filaments, thereby
facilitating the creation of localized domains. The subsequent recruitment
of molecules that have an affinity for these domains is likely to play an
important role in the regulation of Integrin function itself.

JCB, 2006 <br> Energetics and Stability of Human Locomotion: Two vignettes </br><br>In my talk, I will discuss two different projects. One is a
theoretical study on stability-energy tradeoffs for running on uneven
terrain while in the other, we wish to understand what determines the
shape of the energy landscape for human walking. The experiments for the
second project were conducted at the University of Edinburgh, in
collaboration with Prof. Sethu Vijaykumar.
It is common experience that running on rough terrains is more tiring than
on flat terrains. Although measurements on walking on piece-wise flat
terrains with height variation support this perception, there exist no
models or direct measurements on running to test this. We hence presentan
alternative model for the analysis and synthesis of running gaits. We
model running as an impulsive bouncing disc in the sagittal plane. Flight
are punctuated by intermittent contact with the ground during which an
impulse redirects the disc's momentum. Using this model we show that while
stability of open-loop running is improved with energy expenditure, no
running gait is stable on terrains with both height and slope variations.
We provide mechanical intuition as to why leg retraction improves the
stability of open-loop gaits. Finally, we also make a few remarks on
feedback control of running in the context of this model.
It is a widely accepted belief that animals move in ways that minimize
energy consumption. In this second study, we focus on a comparatively less
studied feature of walking energetics; the shape of the energy landscape.
Data shows that the curvature at the minima (with respect to gait
parameters like speed/step frequency) is small, i.e. small changes in
gait parameters lead to much smaller changes in energy expenditure. What
causes the energy landscape to be 'shallow'? Our morphology has certainly
evolved to make us efficient walkers. Motor control is also tuned over
years of learning (since childhood) and presumably all these factors
determine the nature of the energy landscape. In our experiment, we change
the walking environment to a novel scenario in order to negate, to the
extent possible, priors that have been developed from a lifetime of
learning how to walk. We do this by breaking lateral symmetry of walking
using a split-belt treadmill, where the right and left belts move at
different speeds. In this novel walking context, we ask what the shape of
the energy landscape with respect to step frequency is. If subjects have
completely adapted to this walking task, then our energetic results will
pertain to evolved morphology rather than motor control for normal
walking. Is the shallow energy landscape an essential feature of any
walking gait or is it highly tuned for the types of symmetrical gaits that
humans have learnt to use? <br> Effect of FTDP-17 mutations on co-aggregation of alternative forms
(tau-K18 and tau-K19) of tau protein </br><br>Tau is a microtubule-associated, soluble, intrinsically
disordered protein which is expressed in cell bodies and axons of neuronal
cells and regulates the dynamics of microtubule by stabilization of
microtubules. It has four repeats (4R) R1-R4 and a net positive charge at
physiological condition, hence it has less propensity to aggregate. But
the addition of negative charge chemicals like RNA, fatty acids,
archidonic acid, glycosaminoglycans etc. accelerates the aggregation of
tau. Repeat R2 and R3 have two hexapeptide sequences which have high
beta-sheet propensity and hydrophobicity and hence they make the core of
the fibrils. Alteration in conformation from natively unfolded to an
ordered cross-beta structure leads to formation of insoluble fibrils. The
rate limiting step for the tau fibril formation is the formation of
critical nucleus onto which monomer can grow. But this step can be
bypassed by addition of fibril seeds. Previous work has focused on
co-aggregation of tau-K18 (4R) and tau-K19 (3R) and asymmetric barrier
between tau-K18 and tau-K19 has been shown where tau-K19 can act as a seed
for tau-K18 but not the vice-versa. It has been shown that tau-K18 and
tau-K19 fibrils have different conformations which is the main cause of
the asymmetric barrier. The current study aims to understand how changes
in tau protein sequence alter the conformation of fibril/monomer which
can further cross the asymmetric barrier. <br> Role of FMRP in neuronal differentiation </br><br>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of
intellectual deficiency. It is mainly caused due to epigenetic silencing
of the gene and loss of its protein product, FMRP (Fragile X mental
retardation protein). The major function of FMRP in mouse cortical neurons
has been implicated in the regulation of activity mediated translation[2]
of its target mRNAs. In response to group-1 metabotropic glutamate
receptors (mGluR) activation[3], FMRP target mRNAs are translationaly
activated. Apart from mature neurons, FMRP is also highly expressed in
embryonic stem cells and recent studies show that FMRP may play a
significant role in neuronal differentiation. Several studies have shown
altered propensity of embryonic and adult neural stem cell lacking FMRP to
proliferate and differentiate into neurons and astrocytes [4, 5]. Similar
alterations have been observed in case of human FXS patient derived ESC
and iPSC[6, 7]
In the current study we aim to understand the molecular role of FMRP in
the process of differentiation of stem cells into neurons. Using human ESC
derived neurons we wish to understand the poorly studied
neuro-developmental role of FMRP in contrast to its very well studied role
in synaptic plasticityin neurons. We have been able to establish the
differentiation of ESC into neurons. Our preliminary results indicate that
FMRP is expressed in ESC, NPC and Cortical neurons. Interestingly many of
the mRNAs which are targets of FMRP in neurons, such as fmr-1 and Arc are
also expressed in abundance in ESC and NPC. Now we are investigating if
these mRNAs associate with FMRP in ESC and NPC or they associate with FMRP
in cortical neurons. We would also like to identify ESC and NPC specific
mRNA targets of FMRP, their translation regulation and their impact on
neuronal differentiation. <br> Effects of stress on dendritic spine plasticity in the amygdala </br><br>Sensory experience alters neuronal circuits, believed to form
the basis for learning and memory. At the structural level, experience
dependent plasticity is prominently observed as addition or removal of
dendritic spines. Dendritic spines are morphological protrusions from
neurons that typically receive inputs from excitatory presynaptic
terminals. They contain neurotransmitter receptors, essential for synaptic
function and plasticity. Earlier work from our laboratory has shown that
Acute Immobilization Stress (AIS) in rodent models lead to increased
anxiety at the behavioral level 10 days after stress, with increased spine
density at the cellular level in the Basolateral amygdala (BLA). This
buildup of anxiety after 10 days shown in our rodent model is effective in
representing Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in humans. From our
studies we noticed that depletion of Glucocorticoids lead to
stress-induced spinogenesis that is reversed by glucocorticoids
replacement. There are evidences from clinical reports that cortisol
treatment reduces the development of the cardinal symptoms of PTSD.
Inspite of recent advances using physical stressors in rodent models for
understanding their effects on brain circuitry, a purely physical stressor
is a limitation in understanding human stress disorders.
Majority of stress stimuli in humans such as bullying in schools and
workplaces, which leads to psychopathology are of a social nature. A
well-studied animal model for social stress is social defeat stress (SDS).
The social defeat approach uses the "resident-intruder" paradigm, in which
an animal is placed in the cage of another animal or group of animals of
the same species once or twice, in a manner that allows a non-lethal
conflict. Our preliminary studies focusing on the resident shows that
different grades of aggression do not really affect structural morphology
in the BLA. This is unlike the changes we observe with increased
spinogenesis with AIS.
Different amygdala nuclei play distinct roles in the regulation of fear
and anxiety-related defensive behaviors. While BLA?s role in anxiety is
well established, studies show that medial amygdala lesions modify
aggressive behavior during conflict in rodents. Hence, future studies in
the lab are aimed at investigating the role of medial amygdala in
aggression related behavior. Our study aims to compare and contrast the
effects of the above mentioned stress paradigms on dendritic spine
morphology in BLA and the medial nuclei of the amygdala. <br> Selenoportein N1; a novel regulator in muscle differentiation </br><br>Selenoprotein N (SelN; encoded by SEPN1 gene) was the first
Selenoprotein associated to a human genetic disease, SEPN1-related
myopathy (SEPN1-RM), which is typified by severe weakness and wasting of
neck and trunk muscles. Previously we have shown that, in human muscle
cells devoid of SelN, there is an increase in intracellular oxidant
activity, protein carbonylation and ROS sensitivity, suggesting that SelN
plays a key role in antioxidant protection. It has also previously shown
that sepn1-/- mice have a reduced rate of muscle repair and a depletion of
the satellite cell (SC) population after injury when compared to wild-type
mice, linking SelN with the balance between self-renewal and
differentiation of the SCs. Here I present my data, thus far, aimed at
elucidating the role and mechanism by which SelN is involved in the
regulatory balance between differentiation and SC self-renewal. Initially
I have demonstrated that in the absence of SelN, myoblasts (MB) have a
stronger myogenic signature, and differentiate more easily in vitro. This
result is also mirrored in the patient samples. Interestingly, the
?stronger? myogenic appearance of the SelN depleted cells can not be
completely rescued, or induced, by perturbing the cellular redox state,
indicating that SelN has other modes of influence on top of redox
homeostasis. MB cultures with SelN knockdown have a reduced population of
SC-like Pax7+ve reserve cells. Moreover, using a cell suspension induced
quiescence system, these MB cultures appear to be able to enter G0 but
have a more ?activated? transcription signature. Together this data
implicates SelN in both maintaining the inactivated state of G0 cells and
reducing the susceptibility of the activated cells to mature. Is SelN
working as a differentiation brake? <br> Understanding conformational transitions in periplasmic binding
proteins using structure-based models </br><br>Ligand-binding mechanisms for two structurally similar
two-domain proteins, maltose-binding protein (MBP) and histidine-binding
protein (HisJ) are understood using coarse-grained structure-based models
(SBMs). It is hypothesized that MBP and HisJ bind their ligands through
induced-fit and conformational selection mechanisms, respectively. We
establish the structural features inherent to these proteins that govern
their ability to exhibit different ligand binding mechanisms. We find that
a helix connecting the two domains and an additional interface at the back
of the binding pocket serves specifically to stabilizeother hand, MBP
samples its closed state only in the presence of its ligand (ind the
open-state in MBP. A structurally equivalent feature is absent in HisJ.
This correlates with the conformational sampling of the closed state of
HisJ even in the absence of its ligand (conformational selection). On the
uced fit). We propose a model for MBP which could potentially switch its
ligand binding mechanism to conformational selection rather than induced
fit. <br> Exploring dopamine interactions with the human serotonin receptor
family </br><br>Interactions between serotonergic and dopaminergic systems have
been suggested in regulation of various normal physiological processes as
well as many disorders. An extensive amount of work has been done to
understand the mechanism and consequences of such interactions. However, a
lot remains to be understood. The two neurotransmitter systems have been
shown and are presumed to regulate or modulate each other either directly
or indirectly via their own receptor-ligand combinations. However, there
also have been reports of dopamine (DA) directly activating serotonin
(5-HT) receptors and 5-HT directly activating DA receptors as well.
Studies using Xenopus oocytes have shown that DA acts as a partial agonist
at rat 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors as well as the human 5-HT1A, 5-HT2C and
5-HT3 receptors. Previous work done in our laboratory has also shown that
DA acts as a partial-efficacy agonist and activates and internalizes rat
as well as human 5-HT2A receptors expressed in the mammalian cell line
HEK293. DA has also been shown to bind human 5-HT1A. These findings
encouraged us to look for the direct interaction of DA with 5-HT receptors
in detail. We hypothesize that DA can activate a larger group of 5-HT
receptor subtypes. My study aims at determining the affinities of DA for
5-HT receptors and the immediate DA-mediated downstream effects on the
human 5-HT receptors:- 5-HT1A, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors. My studies
with human 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptor expressed in HEK293 cells shows that
DA acts as an agonist on these receptors though with a comparatively lower
efficacy and potency than that of 5-HT. <br> Changes in properties of the cardiac contractile system due to
cardiomyopathy-associated mutations in &#945;-tropomyosin </br><br>Although the heart muscle possesses an incredible ability to
tolerate and adapt to pathological insults to maintain contractile
function, its long-term response to these insults is a maladaptive
remodeling process characterized by hypertrophy and/or dilation. Single
point mutations in any one of the genes encoding the fundamental
sarcomeric proteins have been found to cause inherited cardiomyopathies.
Among those are 30 mutations in TPM1, the gene encoding
&#945;-tropomyosin, a key regulator of calcium dependent contraction of
the sarcomere. Although some of the TPM1 mutants have been extensively
characterized, the same detailed understanding is not available for all
these mutations. The goal of our study is to determine the molecular
mechanisms by which some of the less characterized TPM1 mutations
dysregulate sarcomeric function, particularly the commonalities and
differences.
As the first step I have reconstituted the basic regulated sarcomere
(myosin, actin, troponin, tropomyosin) in vitro and measured the effect of
2 mutations (dilated cardiomyopathy/DCM causing mutation D230N and the
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy/HCM causing mutation M281T) on biochemical
properties including stability of the tropomyosin dimer, binding affinity
to actin, conformational changes of the regulated thin filament, ATPase
activity of the regulated sarcomere and its sensitivity to calcium. While
our results on calcium sensitivity of myosin ATPase activity were
consistent with the hypothesis that HCMs are hypersensitive to calcium
activation and DCMs are hyposensitive, we have also found an interesting
correlation between ATPase activity at maximum calcium and conformational
change in the regulated thin filament.
In another approach to study how these changes at the molecular level get
translated to the cellular level we plan to introduce these mutations into
human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) that will be differentiated to
cardiomyocytes for characterisation. To achieve this we have adopted the
use of transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) to target
the tropmyosin gene and introduce the single amino acid mutations by using
oligonucleotides to guide the repair. <br> Evolution of bacterial gene regulatory circuit design </br><br><p>Gene regulatory circuits enable bacteria to respond to<br />changing environment by altering physiology. These circuits involve<br />sensors, transcription factors, regulatory RNAs, target<br />enzymes/structural proteins which interact as a part of a large network<br />to generate the appropriate physiological responses. A popular idea in<br />the field suggests that certain design patterns ("motifs") in these<br />interaction networks might be optimized to respond to particular features<br />of the environment. Although this idea is well-supported by correlative<br />evidence, evolution of regulatory apparatus is known to be constrained by<br />genetics and conflicting environmental demands. I propose to investigate<br />optimality and constraints in the evolution of specific gene regulatory<br />circuits by evolving bacteria in dynamic but controlled laboratory<br />environments. In the AWS, I will present a model system that I intend to<br />use and some preliminary analysis.</p> <br> Dopamine modulation of descending locomotor control </br><br><p>Reticulospinal neurons (RSNs) are the major descending projections in zebrafish (Danio rerio). These play an important role in regulation of posture and locomotion in all the vertebrates. Given the importance of RSNs in controlling locomotion and escape response, it is important to understand how these are modulated and how these modulations reflect as changes in the motor output. Dopamine is known to be a key regulator of locomotion and understanding its modulation of Reticulospinal neurons (RSNs) could shed light on the role and mechanism of modulation of descending commands in shaping the motor output. In this AWS, I will talk about how I plan to investigate the role of dopamine in modulating the activity of RSNs and what these changes could mean in terms of motor ouput. I will show some preliminary work on characterising the effect of dopamine on the kinematics of swimming.</p> <br> Crosstalk between global transcription regulators Fis and CRP in
E. coli </br><br>Control of transcription initiation is a key step in gene
regulation of bacteria. Multiple players including global transcription
factors and NAPs (nucleoid-associated proteins) are involved in this
process. Two such global regulators in E. coli are CRP (cyclic-AMP
receptor protein) and Fis (factor for inversion stimulation). Apart from
regulating major carbon utilisation pathways, CRP affects the expression
of a diverse set of genes, making it a global regulator. Fis is the most
abundant NAP following nutrient upshift and affects the supercoiling
status of the bacterial nucleoid. The two of them exhibit similar DNA
binding preferences. As a consequence, cross talk can result between these
two factors in binding gene regulatory regions. We are trying to
understand the extent and role of this cross talk during different stages
of bacterial growth and availability of a carbon source (glucose). To this
end, we see a severe growth defect in the double null mutant crp-fis in
comparison to the single null mutants. I will discuss the RNA-seq results
of these mutant strains in mid-exponential growth phase. To see whether
the growth defect of the double null mutant can be rescued, we evolved the
strain by serial passaging. In the evolved crp-fis double null mutant, the
growth defect was partially rescued by inactivating RpoS - a regulator of
the bacterial general stress response. Future experiments will focus on
studying the DNA-binding profile of these proteins, which along with the
transcriptomic data will help elucidate their combinatorial role in the
cell. <br> Neuronal RNP granule assembly: Role in Memory and disease </br><br>Long-term synaptic plasticity requires the presence of
translationally suppressed subsets of mRNAs whose translation is induced
by appropriate local synaptic activity. The underlying translational
control events are governed by mRNA interactions with RNA binding proteins
(RBPs) and the properties of the resultant mRNA-protein complexes (mRNPs).
In vivo, these mRNPs are found in "granules" or "mRNP assemblies," because
individual mRNPs tend to reversibly assemble into aggregates via
aggregation-prone, low complexity domains (LC domains) found frequently on
RBPs. In neurons, this regulated assembly and disassembly of mRNPs are
required not only for long-term memory (LTM) but also for neuronal
maintenance. Thus, mutations that alter these processes can result in
altered memory formation and/or age-dependent neuronal death.
I am currently testing a hypothesis in which neuronal RNP granule proteins
with LC domains bind mRNAs and inhibit translation at resting synapses and
upon stimulation this gets reversed leading to mRNP disassembly,
facilitating active translation that contributes to neuronal modifications
necessary for memory. Mutations that cause decreased assembly will lead to
memory defects and mutations that will enhance the assembly will cause
neurodegeneration. In this AWS, I will discuss the proposed work that will
test the above hypothesis in Drosophila olfactory neurons that encodes a
form of LTM, which allows me to study in vivo mechanisms in a unique
manner (PNAS, 36:108, 2011). Among several neuronal LC-domain RNA granule
proteins, Atx2 has been shown to be required for granule formation and LTM
(PNAS, 36:108, 2011; PNAS, 1:111, 2013). Moreover mutations in LC domain
of this proteins cause neurodegenerative disease. I will dissect in vitro
and in vivo mechanisms of Atx2 assembly and function. This will allow me
to first, better understand neuronal granules and their roles in vivo and
second, set up a platform for comparing the contrasting roles of multiple
LC domain proteins that appear to be involved in neuronal translational
control. <br> Bee Curtain of Asian dwarf honeybee, Apis florea   </br><br><p>Nesting behavior is one of the most characteristic differences<br />among honeybee species and has profound effects on colony organization and individual worker behavior. Colonies of pen-nesting species build only one comb, which contains the brood cells and food stores, and the workers form a cluster of multiple layers, the bee curtain, covering the comb.</p>
<p><br />This bee curtain functions as a protective shield against unfavorable<br />environmental conditions and predators but also likely as a resting place and an additional food store. Although the bee curtain is formed by the majority of colony members, it was suggested that there is a specific curtain bee caste. Unfortunately, such a worker caste has never really been defined or identified with respect to behavior and physiology. In this AWS, I will talk about the first step towards a more detailed study of the bee curtain in Asia dwarf honey bee species, *Apis florea. *</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br> Learning induced activity sequences in the brain </br><br>Animals have the ability to learn causal relationships between
stimuli that are separated in time. This is called trace learning or trace
conditioning (If you have stale coleslaw in the orning and get a stomach
upset in the afternoon, you will know what has caused it). A part of the
brain called the hippocampus, has been known for many years to be
imperative for this kind of learning. However, the mechanisms that
underlie this trace learning are still murky. The network level changes
that occur to accommodate trace conditioning are yet to be explained.
Recent work from our lab has shown that area CA1 cells of the hippocampus
converge to a time locked firing sequence in order to bridge the two
stimuli.
For this AWS I will mostly talk about how we are planning to take this new
finding to greater heights; about some of the short comings of the
previously used protocol, about the new protocol that we are trying to
standardize that will allow us to answer questions that the previous one
could not and also mention some of the obvious questions that the previous
work has left open. <br> Tight apposition and multiple cell-cell contacts mediate myoblast
fusion in Drosophila </br><br>Myoblast fusion is an essential process underlying development,
growth and regeneration of muscles in multicellular organisms. Our work
focuses on an ultra-structural description of the fusion process during
formation of the indirect flight muscles (IFMs) of Drosophila. We have
employed a novel tissue preparation protocol, which allows for
high-quality preservation and visualization of cell membranes, and a
variety of transmission electron-microscopy (TEM) techniques (FIB/SEM,
single section TEM and STEM tomography). Using these methods, we have
identified a series of distinct steps in the IFM myoblast fusion process,
mediated, as genetic analysis suggests, by different cellular machineries.
Cell-adhesion elements are essential for an initial association between
the myoblasts and myotubes. Myoblasts then flatten their surface and move
even closer to the myotubes, a transition that is associated with
formation of multiple point-like contact sites between the two cell types.
Components of the Arp2/3 branched-actin polymerization machinery, as well
as the MARVEL-domain transmembrane protein Singles-bar, are required for
these events. The myotube-myoblast contact sites, which form along long
stretches of the apposed membranes, and are not associated with membrane
protrusions, give rise to multiple nascent fusion pores, which perforate
the cell membranes. The pores grow in size, leading to cell membrane
breakdown and completion of the fusion process. <br> Understanding the mechanism of wound induced stem cell mobilization </br><br>Tissue damage leads to the activation of a wound healing
response in order to restore the structural and functional integrity of
the tissue. Activation and mobilization of stem cells resident in the
injured tissue and from secondary niches help regain the cellular
repertoire of the wounded tissue. What are the signals that regulate this
emergency recruitment of stem cells into the wounded tissue? What is the
molecular basis of this homing behavior? These questions gain importance
in light of the fact that in wound healing disorders, such cellular
responses are impaired. A promising therapeutic strategy would thus be to
manipulate the mobilization of these resident stem cells in order to
stimulate the rapid repair of adult tissues.
The skin has the ability to rapidly regenerate itself following injury
owing to the mobilization of many resident stem cells including the
multipotent hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs). The wound effect is
localized to HFSCs at the wound margin, which show directed migration into
the wound adopting an epidermal fate in contrast to them providing hair
progenitors under homeostatic conditions. This system therefore provides
an ideal system to probe the phenomenon of stem cell chemotaxis as well as
alternate fate restriction in stem cells. The extracellular cue(s) and
subsequent molecular regulation of HFSC migratory behavior is unknown thus
forming the main objectives of my research. To address these questions I
am studying the HFSC mobilization in a mouse model where the whole skin
shows a wound-healing phenotype. I will describe the preliminary data
towards characterizing HFSC migration in this animal model and provide an
outline to the experiments planned. <br> An in vitro strategy to understand cell membrane organisation. </br><br>Many lipid-tethered proteins and glycolipids exist as monomers
and nanoclusters on the surface of living cells. The spatial distribution
and the dynamics of nanoclusters does not reflect thermal equilibrium and
seems to be controlled by active remodeling of cortical actin. In order to
explain this particular behavior of these molecules, a theoretical
framework based on active hydrodynamics of polar filaments was proposed,
wherein cell surface molecules bound to dynamic actin are actively driven
to form transient clusters.
To test the predictions made by this model, particularly the role of
dynamic actin filaments in driving the clustering, and to gain microscopic
details which give rise to the forces and currents leading to cluster
formation, an in-vitro active composite system was introduced consisting
of a supported lipid bilayer with actin-binding proteins, short actin
filaments, myosin motors, capping protein, and ATP. It was found that the
membrane proteins show altered dynamics and transient clustering in the
presence of active acto-myosin motors.
However, many questions remain- in order to completely understand the
contribution of various processes towards the forces and currents leading
to cluster formation. My aim is to further extend this in vitro system,
and address the following points: how would different motor proteins, and
different lipid environments affect the dynamics of actin, and hence the
clustering properties of cell surface molecules? How would the
differential affinity of these molecules towards actin affect their
clustering properties?
In my AWS I will mostly talk about the basics of the in vitro system and
about the strategies which I plan to use to answer the above framed
questions. <br> Phosphatidic acid signaling in Drosophila photoreceptor </br><br><p>Phospholipids play a key role in mediating signal transduction<br />events and intracellular membrane trafï¬cking. Phosphatidic acid<br />(PA) is one such phospholipid that is proposed to regulate both signal<br />transduction as well as membrane trafficking. In order to study PA<br />signaling in detail, we have chosen the Drosophila phototransduction as a<br />model system. Previous studies have shown that regulation of PA levels is<br />critical for photoreceptor structure and function.<br /> PA can be generated in cells by a number of different enzymes, one of<br />which is Phospholipase-D (PLD). PLD hydrolyses phosphatidylcholine (PC)<br />to generate membrane-bound PA and choline. Drosophila melanogaster has a<br />single gene (CG12110) encoding PLD activity. In order to understand the<br />in-vivo relevance of this particular source of PA, we have generated a<br />loss of function mutant of PLD (dPLD3.1).<br /> dPLD3.1 show light dependent retinal degeneration. In this AWS I will<br />present evidence that loss of dPLD activity leads to light dependent<br />retinal degeneration. Mass spectrometric analysis and various genetic<br />manipulations support the idea that degeneration in dPLD3.1 is due to<br />reduced total PA levels. In order to gain mechanistic insight I have<br />also done some work which suggests that increase in endocytosis of<br />rhodopsin loaded vesicles (RLV?s) may be the cause of retinal<br />degeneration in dPLD3.1.</p> <br> Analysis of Phosphatidic acid (PA) molecular species in Drosophila Phototransduction </br><br><p>In depth understanding of any signal transduction process demands quantitation of the molecules involved in the pathway. In order to study signal transduction in such detail, we have chosen the Drosophila phototransduction cycle as a model system. Previous studies from the lab have shown that regulation of phosphatidic acid (PA) levels is critical for photoreceptor structure and function. Apart from the head group, depending on the composition of the fatty acyl chains in SN1 and SN2, there are different molecules within PA lipid class. PA levels in photoreceptors are regulated by multiple enzymes. To study the regulation of the diverse molecular species of PA modulated by enzymes related to phototransduction and enzymes other than phototransduction (mainly Phospholipase D (PLD), I have taken mass spectrometry as a tool. Mass spectrometry, because of its sensitivity and accuracy, has been used as an effective tool to identify and quantify lipids in complex cellular mixtures. The quantification of PA using standard lipidomic platforms represents unique challenges. PA often not detected by standard lipidomics platforms mainly because of its low abundance, ion suppression and lack of characteristics or lipid class specific signatures. Liquid chromatography prior to mass spectrometry helped little bit in this regard. The majority of published literature for analysis of PA relies on triple quadropole mass spectrometry coupled to reverse phase HPLC. We previously reported total level of PA from total lipid extract using high resolution (100,000) and high mass accuracy provided by Orbitrap technology. This particular method lacks its sensitivity in terms of quantization of individual molecular species within PA lipid class. Particularly the composition of fatty acyl chains in SN1 and SN2 could not be properly dissected out. To overcome these problems in measuring PA we need a method which will be (i) direct without any pre-labelling or post processing measurement of phosphate and fatty acids (ii) sensitive enough to detect low abundant molecular species (iii) quantitative and (iv) efficient. In this AWS I will be talking about a MS method development to get the highest number of molecular species of PA with exact composition of fatty acyl chains in SN1 and SN2 carbon and their relative level.</p> <br> Deciphering the role of the RhoA effector mDiaphanous in
regulating MyoD expression </br><br>MyoD, a master transcriptional regulator of the skeletal muscle
lineage is expressed by proliferating and differentiated muscle cells but
suppressed during reversible quiescence, the dormant state of adult muscle
stem cells. Our earlier studies showed that re-activation of MyoD
expression occurs during cell cycle re-entry of G0 myoblasts, and that the
RhoA-actin cytoskeleton-serum response factor (SRF) pathway transduces
this signal to the MyoD promoter. RhoA is a membrane-associated GTPase
whose downstream effector mDiaphanous1 (mDia1) is a scaffold protein that
also channels adhesion-dependent signals to control cell motility and
cytoskeletal dynamics. Previously, we showed that two antagonistic
pathways downstream of mDia1 regulate MyoD: positive regulation by SRF and
negative regulation via &#61538;-catenin and TCF, target transcription
factors of the canonical Wnt pathway. To investigate the mechanism by
which mDia controls these two pathways, we performed a yeast 2-hybrid
screen for mDia1-interacting proteins, using a Rho-independent form
mDia1&#61508;N3. The screen yielded several interacting partners,
including profilin, an actin nucleation factor known to interact with
mDia1, and interestingly, a number of membrane proteins. Phb2 (Prohibitin
2) a novel interactor for mDia1&#61508;N3, was selected for further
analysis. This study deals with the characterization of mDiaphanous1 and
Phb2 interaction. I propose two possible hypotheses for the functional
relevance of mDia1 and Phb2 interaction in regulating MyoD expression. My
results add to the growing evidence that this muscle determination factor
is under extrinsic control by growth factors, transcriptional regulators
and adhesion molecules, in a cell-cycle dependent manner. In future, I
would like to investigate the significance of linking cytoskeletal
signaling to lineage determination in a contractile tissue such as
skeletal muscle. <br> Artificial Induction and Inheritance of Epigenetic Variations </br><br>Small RNA directed gene silencing or RNA interference (RNAi) is
one of the key regulators of gene expression and host defense in plants
and other eukaryotic organisms. Depending on the nature of the viral
nucleic acid and the resulting viral small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), the
plant defense can either be at the transcriptional level (transcriptional
gene silencing, TGS) or at the post transcriptional level
(post-transcriptional gene silencing, PTGS). Based on the fact that
viruses are targeted by the host to produce active viral siRNAs, several
viruses have been modified to introduce small stretch of non-viral nucleic
acid in viral genome to target transgenes and endogens. This process is
called Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS). If the inserted nucleic acid
codes for a protein, then typically a PTGS response results, whereas
promoter element insertion in the viral genome results in TGS. Thus, VIGS
can be used to introduce epigenetic traits. It can also be used as a tool
to elucidate function of unknown genes by silencing it either TGS or PTGS
mediated pathway.
We hypothesized that DNA-viruses are better candidate to induce TGS
because their RNAs are processed into 24 nt siRNAs-an absolute requirement
for TGS. We are checking suitable plant DNA viruses to establish as better
VIGS vectors to either induce heritable epigenetic modification in crop
plants or investigate unknown gene functions. We use previously described
vectors such as RTBV and CbLCV. We have also cloned a novel DNA virus
with high potential for TGS and are trying to construct a VIGS vector
using it. The candidate gene for the functional study is an interesting
epigenetic player, DDM1 (Decrease in DNA methylation). DDM1 was reported
to have a role as a nucleosome remodeler in model plant Arabidopsis
thaliana, but nothing is known so far from other plants. We aim to
optimize VIGS for TGS as well as to understand a chromatin remodeler DDM1,
understanding the function of which is a priority. <br> Actomyosin dynamics drives local membrane composition in an in
vitro active composite layer </br><br>The cell surface provides a platform for processes like
receptor signaling, protein sorting, transport and endocytosis, whose
regulation requires the local control of membrane organisation. Previous
work has implicated a role for dynamic actin laments and myosin motors.
This suggests that the cell surface behaves as an active composite
composed of a fluid bilayer and a thin-fi lm of active acto-myosin. To
demonstrate this novel form of local control of membrane composition, we
reconstitute an analogous active composite in vitro. We explore a rich
phase-diagram of membrane-confi ned acto-myosin con figurations as a
function of filament concentration and length. Upon increasing the level
of available ATP, acto-myosin forms a constitutively remodeling state
which drives local dynamics and clustering of membrane components,
resembling measurements on the cell surface. These results highlight the
fundamental basis of the active composite model of the cell surface and
indicate its relevance to the study of membrane organisation. <br> Missing long range interactions in interleukins IL-33 and IL-1beta
can be correlated to their function </br><br>Evolution has sculpted protein sequences to fold into specific
three dimensional structures that carry out specific functions. Recent
studies find that amino acids that are essential for function lower
protein stability or increase roughness in the folding energy landscape of
the protein. It is important to understand such functional consequences on
protein stability and folding, in order to assess the tolerance of a
protein fold to functional modifications. Those folds which can support a
diversity of protein functions are likely to be more robust and abundant
in nature. One such fold is the beta-trefoil, and proteins having this
fold exhibit a large diversity of functions, including binding to DNA,
carbohydrates, lipids as well as other proteins. In this study, we examine
the structures and folding mechanisms of two interleukin proteins that
have the beta-trefoil fold : IL-33 and IL-1beta. By comparing their
structures and pair-wise interactions to a conserved set of pair-wise
interactions across several beta-trefoil proteins, we identify
interactions that are absent in their protein cores but are conserved
among other beta-trefoil proteins. The absence of these interactions makes
folding faster in both IL-33 and IL-1beta. The residues corresponding to
these missing interactions are close to their receptor binding sites. We
suggest that functional optimization for receptor binding on the exterior
of these proteins may have resulted in the loss of packing interactions in
their protein interior. However, the effect of the loss of these
interactions on the folding rate is significantly larger for IL-33 than
for IL-1beta suggesting that the packing interactions in IL-1beta appear
to be perturbed to a lesser extent. Whether this is due to the differences
in the binding strengths of the two proteins to their receptors or due to
compensatory packing interactions in IL-1beta is the subject of ongoing
work. <br> Minimal models of Golgi directed glycan synthesis </br><br>All cells have an array of extracellular glycans that decorate
membrane embedded proteins. These glycans often function as name-tags for
the organism and the cell type, and so ensuring that the structures are
consistently generated is essential for the cell. Given that there is
diversity in the glycans but that the structures are consistently
generated, how these glycans are produced given a limited set of
glycosyltransferases is an open question. Unlike other biological
macromolecules like proteins, RNA and DNA, there is no template driven
synthesis for glycans. We hope to explore how eukaryotic cells encode a
consistent distribution of glycan structures. Given locally acting
enzymes, we predict the order in which these glycans are assembled and the
order of enzymes in different Golgi compartments. <br> Developing synthetic biomolecular interactions to stimulate T cell
receptor signaling in Jurkat cells </br><br>T cells are activated when the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR)
binds to antigenic peptides bound in the major histocompatibility complex
(pMHC), expressed on the surface of antigen presenting cells. TCR
signaling is mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation but the receptor itself
has no intrinsic kinase activity. The molecular mechanism by which
TCR-pMHC bind energy is ?read-out? to trigger T-cell activation remains
unclear. To address this question we have developed a synthetic monomeric
T-cell receptor that consisted of the cytoplasmic phosphorylation sites
from CD3zeta fused to an extracellular SNAP domain. By generating ssDNA
SNAP substrates we can chemically couple short oligo nucleotides to this
synthetic monomeric receptor on extracellular surface of a Jurkat cell. We
demonstrate that DNA hybridization between an ssDNA labeled receptor and a
complementary ssDNA ligand immobilised on a supported lipid bilayer is
sufficient to induce cell spreading and the formation of signaling
micro-clusters. The downstream kinase effector ZAP70 and the inhibitory
phosphatase CD45 are recruited and excluded, respectively, from these
micro-clusters. Furthermore, Jurkat T cells are able to dynamically
reorganize these signaling domains into a pattern that is analogous to an
immunological synapse. This monomeric receptor can activate the MAP kinase
signaling cascade, as read out by phosphoERK, and induce CD69 expression.
We have used this system to titrate the minimal ssDNA sequence with the
sufficient binding energy to activate the T-cell signaling cascade. By
selective truncation of a simple 16mer sequence we find that shorter
oligos have a weaker phosphoERK dose response, with signaling abolished at
11 base pairs. However by mutating adenine-thymine base pairs to
guanine-cytosine, with the net addition of a single H-bond, we can restore
receptor activation. Finally we have measured at single molecule
resolution the receptor-ligand bound time in the context of the
cell:supported-lipid-bilayer interface and find that a two fold difference
separates activating and non-activating ligands. These results suggest
that the proximal T-cell signaling network can discriminate between subtle
changes in ligand binding energy at the resolution of single H-bonds. In
conclusion we have reduced the receptor ligand binding to DNA
hybridization and developed a programmable system with a large parameter
space to quantify the biophysical properties of T-cell activation. <br> mRNP granules in muscle cells: A role in quiescence </br><br>Dormant or quiescent stem cells persist as in most adult
tissues, and are thought to employ multiple mechanisms to preserve their
progenitor capacity. Recent reports suggest that quiescent skeletal muscle
stem cells (satellite cells) exhibit translational repression, wherein key
activation genes are transcribed but these mRNAs are shifted to an
untranslated pool, and rapidly remobilized onto polysomes and translation
upon activation. Translational pausing is regulated by a group of dynamic
RNA binding proteins, also known as mRNP granules. These mRNPs play a
critical role in regulating mRNA decay, transport and translation.
Earlier, transcriptome profiling in the lab showed that transcripts
encoding mRNP granules are induced in the quiescent state. Our recent
studies reveal that the proteins that are known to be a part of these
complexes are also differentially expressed in the quiescent and
proliferative states. Additionally, an overall reduction of the decay
complexes, but not of other high molecular weight complexes engaged in
translational pausing were observed under quiescence indicating that the
quiescent state is more efficient in translational pausing than mRNA
decay. To further understand how these differences in the composition of
mRNP complexes affect the quiescent state, I have knocked down
differentially expressed protein components of the mRNP complexes and
monitored granule composition and dynamics, as well as effects on
quiescence or differentiation. Progress towards understanding the decay
vs. storage role of mRNP granules in muscle progenitor cell function will
be presented. <br> Denaturant Induced Unfolding of SH3 Domain PI3 Kinase Probed by
Hydrogen Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry. </br><br>Proteins are very dynamic molecules. Under native conditions
protein undergoes a variety of structural openings. Structural
characterization of such opening events can probably tell us about the
pathway(s) protein follows to fold or unfold. Guanidine HCl (GdnHCl) and
urea are the two most commonly used denaturants to characterize folding
and unfolding of proteins. However, clear understanding of how these
denaturants, modulate unfolding of protein is lacking. Structural openings
under native conditions are very rare events and it is difficult to study
them by conventional probes. In the current study, native state dynamics
of SH3 domain of PI3 kinase in presence and absence of denaturants was
performed, in conjunction with hydrogen deuterium exchange mass
spectrometry (HDX-MS). Native state exchange data suggests that SH3
unfolds in two parallel pathways. One is N-->U direct pathway and another
is N-->I1 -->I2-->U. Native state evolves to intermediate I1 in a gradual
manner via local opening events. Intermediate I1 undergoes local as well
as transient global opening events. In presence of strong denaturing
condition (1.8M GdnHCl and 5M Urea), it appears that, same unfolding
pathway is operated. <br> DARPP-32 expression patterns in the larval zebrafish brain </br><br>Neuromodulation refers to change of information on the
synaptic level as well as alteration of intrinsic conductances within
neurons. It is the combination of neurotransmission and neuromodulation
with intracellular pathways that determine the output of a neuron and
subsequently the performance of neural circuits. One of the most important
neuromodulators for functioning motor behaviour is dopamine. One of the
key integrators of dopaminergic signaling is the dopaminergic and cyclic
adenosine 3?5? monophosphate regulated neuronal phosphoprotein DARPP-32. 
Though DARPP-32 has been discovered 30 years ago, not much is known about
its physiological function in intact neural circuits and its potential
role during the establishment of neural circuits. Taking advantage of the
excellent experimental opportunities the zebrafish offers we want to
investigate the effect of DARPP-32 on circuit formation and functioning.
Prior to our work nothing was known about the distribution of DARPP-32 in
the zebrafish nervous system. Whole mount immunofluorescence staining
revealed that DARPP-32 is highly expressed in Purkinje neurons from 3 days
post fertilization onwards. Purkinje neurons are prominent cells of the
cerebellum. Knowing the importance of dopamine and the cerebellum for
correct motor behavior together with the presence of DARPP-32 in Purkinje
neurons motivated us to investigate the effect of the neuromodulator
dopamine and the signal integrator DARPP-32 on cerebellar circuitry. <br> Biochemical analysis of Phosphatidic acid (PA) signaling in
Drosophila phototransduction </br><br>In depth understanding of any signal transduction process
demands quantitation of the molecules involved in the pathway. In order to
study signal transduction in such detail, we have chosen the Drosophila
phototransduction cycle as a model system. This cycle involves a G protein
coupled phosphoinositide pathway, where hydrolysis of phosphatidyl
inositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) by phospholipase C generates
inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and diacyl glycerol (DAG), leading to
activation of Ca2+-permeable light-sensitive channels. Previous studies
from the lab have shown that regulation of phosphatidic acid (PA) levels
is critical for photoreceptor structure and function. PA levels in
photoreceptors are regulated by multiple enzymes; however the importance
of PA generated by each of these in unknown. One of these enzymes is
Phospholipase-D (PLD) which hydrolyses phosphatidylcholine (PC) to
generate membrane-bound PA and choline. Drosophila melanogaster has a
single gene (CG12110) encoding PLD activity. In order to understand the
in-vivo function of this particular source of PA, our lab has generated a
loss of function mutant of PLD (dPLD3.1). dPLD3.1 show light dependent
retinal degeneration. To understand the biochemical basis of this retinal
degeneration, I have studied the regulation of the diverse molecular
species of PA modulated by each of these enzymes using direct infusion
mass spectrometry (Shotgun-MS). Mass spectrometric analysis and various
genetic manipulations support the idea that degeneration seen in dPLD3.1
is due to reduced total PA levels. Using this technique I am also
addressing two major questions. (A) Is there any specificity of enzymatic
product at molecular level in the sensory transduction of Drosophila? (B)
What is the role of diverse molecular species of (PA), the key
intermediate in signaling cascade, in the phototransduction cycle? This
will help us understand the signaling role of PA. <br> Sonic Hedgehog: Companions matter </br><br>Hedgehog (Hh) is a secreted morphogen that elicits
differentiation and patterning in developing tissues. Multiple proposed
mechanisms to regulate Hh dispersion include lipoprotein particles and
exosomes. We report that vertebrate Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) is secreted on
two types of extracellular-vesicles/exosomes, from human cell lines and
primary chick notochord cells. Although largely overlapping in size as
estimated from electron micrographs, the two exosomal fractions exhibited
distinct protein and RNA composition. I will be presenting results on the
functional properties of these vesicles estimated using cell-based assays
of Hh-elicited gene expression. Our results suggest that while both
Shh-containing exo-vesicular fractions can activate an ectopic
Gli-luciferase construct, only exosomes co-expressing Integrins can
activate endogenous Shh target genes HNF3&#61538; and Olig2 during the
differentiation of mouse ES cells to ventral neuronal progenitors. Taken
together, our results demonstrate that primary vertebrate cells secrete
Shh in distinct vesicular forms, and support a model where packaging of
Shh along with other signaling proteins such as Integrins on exosomes
modulates target gene activation. <br> Testing the interaction between migration and adaptation to
novel dietary resource using experimental evolution. </br><br>Adaptation to a novel environment often leads to divergence of
the adapting population from the ancestral population. How migration
affects this divergence is understood mostly through theoretical models
and studies which assume that the population size of the adapting
population remains constant over time. However, the size of an adapting
population is known to change drastically in novel environments, and thus
the assumption of a constant population size over time is unrealistic. I
propose to study the effect of migration on adaptation (and divergence)
in a setup which allows for fluctuation in population size over time. In
this AWS, I would be discussing the experimental evolution design that I
propose to use for testing these effects. I would also be talking about
the pilot data from experiments testing fitness on 9 different resources
of the outbred line that I created for conducting the experimental
evolution. <br> Biochemical insights into inherited cardiomyopathies. </br><br>Primary inherited cardiomyopathies are most frequently caused
by a single amino acid substitution in a single sarcomeric protein. These
pathogenic substitutions alter calcium sensitivity or power of muscle
contraction. Tropomyosin is a sarcomeric protein that occupies a central
position in the regulation of muscle contraction. I will summarize
findings that shed light on the heterogeneity of molecular dysfunction in
tropomyosin mutants. With this background, I will then discuss recent
investigations into the heterozygotic basis of cardiomyopathy and possible
reasons of how/why myosin mutants also show a change in calcium
sensitivity. <br> Re-visiting myosin families through large-scale sequence searches
leads to the discovery of new myosins </br><br>Myosins are fascinating actin-based mechanoenzymes known to
play fundamental roles in many forms of eukaryotic motility processes such
as cell crawling, cytokinesis, phagocytosis, maintenance of cell shape and
in organelle trafficking1. The large-scale genome sequencing efforts
have resulted in a complete or nearly complete draft of genomes from the
paramount groups of eukaryotes and the last decade witnessed a remarkable
explosion in the size and diversity of the myosin family. Since these
actin-based motors are viable candidates to understand the molecular basis
of many cellular movements, it is essential to know the various types of
myosins within an organism.
To delineate the extent of myosin diversity, we have employed
computer-based search algorithms to identify and validate the predicted
putative myosin members by phylogenetic analysis and domain content2.
This work provides insights not only into the distribution and probable
function of myosins, the information gathered from such the sequence
analysis has enabled us to identify new myosin classes. The conserved
regions in the motor domain of the myosins have been analysed and this
would further enable in the investigation of the already existing x-ray
crystal structures of myosins.

 <br> Optogenetic probing of hippocampal spike triplet based plasticity </br><br>Hippocampus is the brain region known to be responsible for
formation of new memories. The standing theory in the field is that
changes in synaptic strengths of neurons is majorly the basis for
formation and alteration of memories. Initial neuronal stimulation
protocols which caused sustainable changes in synaptic strengths were far
from physiological. More than a decade ago, a seemingly more physiological
rule called Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) was observed in
hippocampal cultures - wherein the synapse showed potentiation or
depression depending purely on the the relative timing of the presynaptic
and postsynaptic spikes. Further experiments showed that STDP was not able
to elicit the same changes in acute hippocampal slices and that opened the
possibility of some other rule existing in this system. And there is no a
priori reason to believe that, as a unit of plasticity, pairs of spikes
are more relevant than triplets or quadruplets or some other spike
combinations. Based on recent literature, in order to explore what might
lead to spike timing based changes in hippocampus, we decided to look at a
spike triplet based plasticity rule.
We did DLP-projector based stimulation of Channelrhodopsin2, a light
sensitive ion channel, embedded in the membranes of the presynaptic
neurons (CA3). Responses were recorded from single postsynaptic (CA1)
neurons before and after the triplet plasticity protocol. In the
forthcoming talk, I will be discussing some of the initial results of
these experiments. <br> How connected will mammal populations be in the future? </br><br>Rapid economic and human demographic growth in the Indian sub-
continent has intensified human impacts on various taxa including several
mammals and their habitats. Anthropogenic impacts have lead to severe
habitat loss and fragmentation creating islands or patches of suitable
habitat located in a hostile and heterogeneous matrix. Species may show
variation in their response to fragmentation based on differences in their
dispersal abilities, generation times, area requirements and differential
ability to use the heterogeneous matrix between habitat patches. I wish to
explore how different species have responded to the past forest
fragmentation by looking at their current genetic structure. I will be
presenting some preliminary results from one of my study species, the
tiger. I will present analyses on inferring impacts of different landscape
features on genetic connectivity and simulate how connectivity may be
affected in the future by development projects and associated landuse
change. <br> 5-HT2A receptor modulates the sensitivity of clozapine induced
sedation to environmental context. </br><br>Moreover, the effect of non-pharmacological factors like
environmental context, onto the effects of antipsychotics has been largely
overlooked.
In my earlier presentations, I had discussed an interesting drug ? gene-
environment interaction, wherein the 5-HT2A receptor and the environmental
context (home or novel) modulate the sedative side effect of clozapine.
Using a global 5-HT2A knockout (KO) mouse, I had shown that the 5-HT2A KO
mice are susceptible to sedation induced by clozapine when treated in
their home cage, but are resistant to sedation if exposed to a novel
context. At the same dose of clozapine, wild type (WT) mice underwent
sedation irrespective of the context. Exposure to a novel environment can
be stimulating due to increased arousal and/or anxiety. Here I show that
the stimulating conditions of novel environment can also be induced in the
home cage by using an extensively used stimulant i.e. caffeine. Similarly
the stimulating effect of a novel environment can be suppressed to mimic
home cage conditions by using an anxiolytic drug i.e. diazepam. I have
also observed that the effect of environmental context on sedation is not
specific to clozapine but can be mimicked by 5-HT2A ? specific antagonist
ketanserin. In conclusion, I present evidence that there may be more than
one pathway for clozapine induced sedation, which differs from each other
in their sensitivity of novel context. <br> Is homeostatic plasticity impaired in the amygdala in Fragile X
Syndrome? </br><br>Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common cause of inherited
intellectual disability with an incidence rate of 1 in every 2000-4000
males and 1 in every 7000-8000 females. It is a trinucleotide repeat
disorder caused by silencing of the Fmr1 gene and hence the absence of
Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). Patients with FXS exhibit a
range of symptoms indicating towards amygdalar dysfunction. Although there
has been a lot of work done in the field towards understanding the role of
FMRP in the context of hippocampus, amygdala as usual has been a
less-explored brain region. Additionally, there has been a lot of work
focussing on aberrant synaptic plasticity in FXS but surprisingly very
little is known about the status of homeostatic plasticity in the same
context. In this AWS, I would be talking about homeostatic plasticity in
the amygdala in FXS, the work done so far and how will I like to take the
project further on. <br> Investigating the dynamics of CLIC/GEECformation and the molecular
players involved using singlemolecule visualization techniques </br><br>The CLIC/GEEC (CG) endocytic pathway is responsible for the
internalization of membrane including some specific cargo such as GPI-APs
(glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins), CD44as well as the bulk
of the fluid phase in a wide variety of cell types. This is a RhoGTPase
family, CDC42 regulated, clathrin and dynamin-independent endocytic
pathway. A few molecular players involved in the functioning of this
pathway have been identified; however, the precise roles of these players
in the generation of initial endocytic carriers and their consumption into
GEECs have not been fully investigated. Without the identification of a
clear coat in the nascent budded vesicles (CLICs), it has been speculated
that the recruitment of CDC42 dependent actin polymerization machinery is
important in the mechanics of formation of the vesicle. To address the
roles of potential membrane and cytosolic proteins in CG formation, we
have developed a live cell assaythat captures the pinching of CLICs from
the cell surface in real time. This allows us to map the dynamics ofCG
endocyticcomponents at high temporal and spatial resolution.
Using this assay, we show that CDC42 concentrates at CG endocytic sites
just before the CLICs are pinched off from the plasma membrane while
clathrin and dynamin show minimal localization to newly forming endocytic
structures. We further tested role of a few BAR (Bin?Amphiphysin?Rvs)
domain proteins which are known to recognize/stabilize membrane
curvatures. GRAF1 that has been shown to localize on GEECs, is present on
endosomes at various stages of pre- and post-pinching. We have also shown
PICK1 (known to interact with ARF1 and ARP2/3) affects CG endocytosis and
dynamically localizes to newly pinched endosomes. The dynamics of other
molecular players and changes in GPI nanoclustering at these structures
are currently being investigated. <br> Understanding the mechanism of action of phosphatidylinositol
transfer proteins (PITPs) in vivo </br><br>Phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PITPs) are proteins
capable of binding and transferring single molecule of
phosphatidylinositol (PI) between membranes in vitro. These are expressed
in all eukaryotes and have been identified as key players in numerous
signalling pathways relying on phosphatidylinositol (PI) metabolites.
Notably they are required for required for regulated exocytosis , for
receptor-stimulated turnover of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate
(PIP2) by phospholipaseC (PLC), for phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)
activity, and for budding of immature secretory granules from the trans
Golgi network. Although PITPs have been implicated as essential co-factors
required to support several signalling events that involve PIP2 turnover ,
the basis of their requirement during physiological signalling is not
clear. My work aims to try and understand the mechanism of action of PITPs
in vivo , using Drosophila photoreceptors (PRs) as a model system.
Drosophila PRs express a multi-domain PITP namely RDGB. In my previous
presentation, I had shown the phenotypic characterisation of rdgB mutants
and its rescue with the expression of the PITP domain alone, at the level
of ultra structural integrity and neuronal response to light. In this
presentation I will show results that demonstrate the existence of defect
in PIP2 recovery in the rdgB mutants during light stimulation. Detailed
examination shows that the PITP domain of RDGB is essential but not
sufficient to mediate all the functions of RDGB. RDGB is a membrane
associated protein that is known to localize at PM-ER interface.
Considering the possibility that the activity of RDGB requires presence of
stable PM-ER contact sites, I have designed a small genetic screen to
identify conserved potential tethers which make these contact sites. I
will discuss the basis and design of the screen. <br> Dissecting the role of tumor suppressor PRDM2/RIZ in quiescent
muscle stem cells </br><br>The ability to enter and exit the quiescent state (G0), a
temporary, reversible cell cycle arrest, is critical for stem cells of
adult tissues, and de-regulation of quiescence can lead to either cancer
or degenerative disease. The transcriptional program of quiescent
myoblasts was recently defined, where G0 is associated with induction of
tumour suppressor genes and inhibitors of differentiation (Subramaniam et
al., PLoS One, 2013). In particular, the tumor suppressor PRDM2/RIZ was
identified as a key regulator of quiescence in muscle cells. PRDM2
belongs to the PR domain zinc finger family of chromatin proteins
implicated in the control of division and differentiation. Using alternate
promoters, the PRDM2 locus encodes 2 proteins RIZ1 and RIZ2, which differ
only in the presence of a PR-SET domain (histone-methyltransferase domain)
at the N
terminal. While RIZ1 expression is often silenced in human tumors, RIZ2, a
shorter isoform of RIZ, expression is either un-affected or
over-expressed, suggesting a positive selection for RIZ2 in cancer
progression. Our ongoing work shows that PRDM2 not only functions as a
fail-safe repressor of differentiation specifically in quiescent cells,
but also works to preserve the cell cycle from irreversible silencing. As
a result, it appears to orchestrate a network of regulatory events that
control and define the feature of adult stem cells- absence of
differentiation and reversible arrest. However, the mechanisms of this
regulation are unknown. To address this lacuna, we are using both gain of
function (overexpression) and loss of function (siRNA) analyses. Although
PRDM2/RIZ was discovered as an RB-interacting protein, the consequences of
this interaction are unexplored.. We are working to identify the
interacting partners of PRDM2 in quiescent cells and to elucidate the
network that regulates both differentiation and cell cycle.Since RB
proteins play a key role in cell cycle transitions, specific interaction
of PRDM2 and RB proteins is suggestive of a unique regulation of
quiescence. To identify novel interactors of the two isoforms we have
developed a biotin-streptavidin based immunoprecipitation assay. This was
successfully used to pull-down RIZ interacting proteins, which were then
subjected to mass-spectrometruc analysis. I will present my ongoing work
on the candidate hits and the significance of these interactions in the
context of quiescence. <br> Gene position dynamics in bacteria and effect of growth on genome
architecture </br><br>Relating genotype to phenotype is a complex biological problem.
It involves understanding of how a known genotype gives rise to an
observed phenotype. An important though less studied aspect of genotype to
phenotype problem is, understanding the effect of genome architecture on
phenotype. Genome architecture refers to the positioning and arrangement
of genes on the chromosome. Recent studies in bacteria have shown that
change in gene position can significantly affect gene expression levels. 
Gene expression levels are tightly regulated in bacteria, implicating
importance of conservation of gene positions. Albeit, studies have shown
recombination and horizontal gene transfer, which is common in bacteria,
leads to gene rearrangements and hence change in gene positions. Given
this, it is interesting to study gene position dynamics and gene order
conservation (i.e. genome architecture) in bacteria.
In this study, we take a comparative genomics approach to understand
bacterial genome architecture. We compare gene positions of orthologs
across pairs of closely related bacteria. We assign ortholog positions to
four equal sized chromosomal macro-domains (or bins) namely origin
(includes oriC), right, terminus (includes ter) and left macro-domain. Our
findings suggest significant enrichment of translation genes in the origin
macro-domain. And extensive gene transitions across the left and right
macro-domains. Further, our chromosomal macro-domain independent approach
to understand genome architecture reveals that gene order conservation
varies as a function of bacterial growth rate. With fast growing bacteria
showing higher degree of gene order conservation. Thus, we show that
growth phenotype shapes genome organization proximal to origin of
replication and is associated with gene order conservation in bacteria.

TROPICAL RAINFORESTS. </br><br>Tropical rainforests are characterized by annual rainfall
global Net Primary Productivity (NPP), and play critical roles in
regulating the global carbon cycle. Variation in NPP is driven by several
factors, of which mean annual precipitation (MAP) is considered
particularly important. Previous studies have shown a non-monotonic
relationship between mean annual precipitation (MAP) and NPP, where NPP
tends to increase with increasing MAP until about 2000-3000 mm of
precipitation after which it declines. In areas of low MAP, NPP is limited
by water availability. However, what limits NPP at higher rainfall sites
is unclear. One potential explanation for the lower NPP at high rainfall
sites is that excessive rainfall leads to greater run-off and leaching of
nutrients. The magnitude of nutrient loss is also potentially contingent
on precipitation seasonality. For a given MAP, nutrient loss from the
system is predicted to be more pronounced in highly seasonal environments
where the bulk of rain falls within a short rainy season, as opposed to
aseasonal environments where rainfall is distributed more evenly through
the year. Here, I will be talking about the effect of precipitation
seasonality on nutrient stocks in tropical rainforests, and its
implications for carbon dynamics. <br> Chaperone assisted folding of the heterodimeric protein monellin </br><br>Little is known about how chaperones facilitate chain
complementation during folding of multimeric proteins, in spite of the
fact that majority of the substrates of the most abundant E. coli
chaperone, GroEL-ES system, are multimeric proteins. The ability of
GroEL-ES chaperone system to assist in the folding of heterodimeric
monellin (dcMN) is being studied. The folding and unfolding pathways of
dcMN have been well characterized previously. It is known that completely
unstructured chains A and B associate to form an encounter complex C,
which then folds to the native state, utilizing multiple pathways, with or
without forming intermediates. It is also known that GroEL modulates the
folding energy landscape of the single chain variant of monellin. dcMN
makes for an interesting model system, because chain association is the
first step of protein folding, thus allowing for possibly delineating the
effects of chaperone on chain association from that on folding.
In this AWS I?ll show that individual unstructured chains of dcMN bind to
GroEL with submicromolar affinities, calculated from monitoring changes in
fluorescence intensity and anisotropy following binding. These experiments
also suggest that both chains have more than one binding sites on GroEL,
which seem identical and non-interacting. Chains A and B seem to
complement in presence of GroEL, and fluorescence and FRET experiments are
being performed to investigate the exact role of the chaperone in this
process of chain complementation. <br> Widening the gap-From electrical to chemical synapses </br><br><p>Neurons communicate with each other via gap junctions and chemical synapses. The exact relationship between formation of gap junctions and chemical synapses is still unknown. Gap junctions are encoded by a number of genes in the teleost system. Connexin-35 (Cx-35) is one such gene that has a widespread presence in the central nervous system. We know the expression patterns of Cx-35 in zebrafish at various developmental stages, based on Cx-35 immunohistochemistry, with strong expression seen in the purkinje neurons of the cerebellum. Miniature excitatory post synaptic currents (mEPSCs) recorded in purkinje neurons of control and Cx-35 knocked down larvae show a decreased frequency in the latter, but with no change in the amplitude of the currents, as compared to the control group.</p>
<p>Chemical synapses are composed of various different proteins encoded by different genes, one of which is the post synaptic density-95 gene (psd-95). PSD-95 scaffold protein is a docking site for glutamatergic receptors like AMPARs and NMDARs, and glutamatergic synapses are the most abundant in the CNS. Based on these facts, I am interested in asking whether gap junctions guide the formation of chemical synapses. To answer this, I plan to clone the Cx-35 gene (to visualize gap junctions) and the psd-95 (to visualize glutamatergic synapses) under a pan-neuronal promoter, HuC and microinject the assembled clones into single celled zebrafish embryos. Live imaging of the injected larvae would then allow me to follow the Cx-35 and PSD-95 punctae. If my hypothesis is true, I should see the PSD-95 puncta follow the same trajectory as the Cx-35 puncta.</p> <br> Regulation of PtdIns5P in Drosophila melanogaster </br><br>Phosphatidylinositol is a glycerophospholipid that can be
phosphorylated at position 3, 4, or 5 of the inositol ring, to generate a
set of molecules with multitude of activities in biological systems.
Phosphatidylinositol 5 phosphate (PtdIns5P) is a mono-phosphorylated
phosphoinositide, whose level in the cell is reported to be very low. Many
signalling roles have been implicated for this lipid from work done in the
past decade. Therefore, it is very important to study the regulation of
this lipid inside the cell. The homologues of the mammalian genes that
have been implicated in the regulation of this lipid are present mostly in
single numbers in Drosophila, thus promising it to be a good model system
to study the regulation of this lipid, in vivo. Based on the route by
which they may synthesize PtdIns5P, these genes can be broadly 
categorized into a PIKfyve dependant source, which include a PIP
kinase, Fab1 and a 3-phosphatase, Mtm in Drosophila and a PIKfyve
independent source which includes a single putative 4-phosphatase,
CG6707. Recently it has been shown that mutants of phosphatidylinositol 5
phosphate 4 kinase (dPIP4K), a major regulator of PtdIns5P, show elevated
levels of PtdIns5P and a reduction in cell size (Gupta et al., 2013).
Using this model system I am investigating the mechanisms by which
PtdIns5P may be generated in vivo and its role in the regulation of cell
size. In this AWS, I will be presenting some preliminary data on
perturbations of Fab1 and Mtm in wildtype and dPIP4K mutant background,
which results in modulation of the cell size measured in the third instar
wandering larvae stage of Drosophila. <br> Investigating the structural heterogeneity in the foldinglandscape of single chain monellin </br><br><p>Protein folding for a very long time was believed to be a two state process. However, with more sensitive instrumentation the gradual and continuous nature of protein structure formation is becoming evident. Also, there is enough evidence that folding occurs via multiple pathways instead of a single defined pathway. My project aims to investigate the structural features of intermediates that get populated in multiple folding routes. The model protein for my study is single chain monellin. Earlier studies in the lab have identified intermediates populating in multistate gradual unfolding pathways using a variety of probes. I am interested in probing the refolding intermediates using time resolved FRET measurements. I have started with the equilibrium studies to get an insight into structural heterogeneity of the folding landscape. Preliminary data with time resolved FRET measurements coupled to maximum entropy method based analysis indicate equilibrium populations of highly heterogeneous intermediates.</p> <br> Does eutrophication affect plant-mycorrhizae interactions? </br><br>Most land plants invest carbon in arbuscular mycorrhizal
fungal mutualists (AMF) that improve host plant access to nutrients like
nitrogen and phosphorous, and resources like water in the soil. Several
top-down and bottom-up drivers, such as herbivory and soil resource
availability, can affect plant investment in AMF. Resource
availability,in turn, can be altered by global change factors such as
atmospheric nutrient deposition, changes in precipitation and temperature
rise.
Atmospheric nutrient deposition is predicted to drastically increase the
amounts of plant-available nutrients in the soil, especially in the
tropics. This is likely to drive changes in plant investment in
nutritional symbionts such as AMF, with follow-on effects for ecosystem
processes involving carbon and nutrients. What is the direction and
magnitude of AMF responses to increased nutrient availability in tree
species constituting dry forests, India?s largest forest type? Are there
differences in responses between legumes and non-legumes, the two major
functional groups of dry forest trees with different nutrient acquisition
strategies? In this AWS, I will discuss preliminary results addressing the
above questions from a pot experiment studying dry forest tree species
responses to increased nutrient availability. I will also briefly discuss
future work aimed at understanding the impact of other global change
factors, such as precipitation change and warming, on plant-microbial
mutualist interactions. <br> Role of neurons in the PAM cluster and thoracic ganglia in
regulating SOCE mediated flight in Drosophila. </br><br>Inositol 1,4,5 Tris phosphate (IP3 ) is a second messenger
produced through phosphoinositide turnover in response to various
extracellular stimuli such as hormones, neurotransmitters etc. and
induces Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, like Endoplasmic Reticulum
(ER). IP3 binds to its receptor (IP3R) on the ER membrane causing Ca2+
release from the ER. STromal Interaction Molecule (encoded by dSTIM in
Drosophila), an ER membrane resident protein senses Ca2+ depletion in the
ER, clusters with Orai channel (dOrai) , a CRAC (Calcium release Activated
Calcium) channel in the plasma membrane is formed and as a result it
brings Ca2+ inside the cell called as Store Operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE).
Null mutants of Drosophila IP3R are larval lethal. Heteroallelic
combinations of EMS generated point mutants were found to be viable and
flight defective . Previous studies in the lab has shown that itpr gene is
required during pupal stages of development in aminergic neurons (marked
by DdcGAL4) for flight . Among the aminergic neurons, the requirement of
IP3R in dopaminergic neurons (marked by TH GAL4) for flight are also well
established. TH GAL4 expressing neurons in the brain are classified into
13 different classes scattered on the anterior and posterior faces of the
protocerebrum. Here I?m trying to understand the role of neurons in one of
these clusters, the PAM (Protocerebral Anterior Medial) and another subset
of neurons in the thoracic ganglia in regulating flight through IP3 and
SOCE. In this AWS, I will be discussing some of the preliminary data
suggesting that SOCE in these neurons is important for flight in
Drosophila. <br> Remodulation of H-NS and RpoS global regulatory networks under
prolonged stationary-phase in E. coli </br><br>Microbial habitats are highly dynamic due to environmental
factors as well as microbial activity. Bacteria have thrived in such
constantly changing niches by evolving both physiological as well as
genetic strategies. As a short term adaptation, bacteria quickly respond
to environmental insults by rapidly modulating gene-expression through
specific sets of sensors and response-regulators. However if stress
persists, genetic changes that enhance fitness are accumulated.
A demonstration of the above stated strategies can be seen in laboratory
cultures of E. coli. Re-programming of gene-expression during transition
from exponential to stationary phase by the stationary-phase sigma factor
RpoS, is a classic case of short term adaptation. If the stationary-phase
is prolonged, E. coli cultures accumulate mutants that are better adapted
under the prevailing conditions compared to the parent. These mutants are
referred to as Growth Advantage in Stationary Phase mutants (GASP). As the
culture ages there is a continuous selection of such mutants. The first
GASP mutant isolated from a 10 days old culture carried an attenuated
allele of rpoS, named rpoS819. A second round of incubation (28 days) of a
strain carrying the rpoS819 allele resulted in the selection of a second
mutation in the gene encoding the global repressor H-NS. Like rpoS819, the
altered allele of hns referred to as hns66 also encodes a partially
compromised repressor. Fitness manifestation of rpoS819, or hns66, alone
or together, depends on the genomic background as well as the stage of the
stationary-phase. RpoS and H-NS, control a set of genes that belong to
stress-related functional modules. To gain insights on the allele specific
modulation of the general stress response network, the global profiling of
gene-expression in the strains carrying the rpoS819 and hns66 alleles,
alone as well as in different combinations was carried out. Preliminary
results suggest that H-NS66 derepresses only a subset (60%) of genes of
the H-NS regulon. Moreover, the fold-changes are also lower as compared to
the wild-type repressor. RpoS819 however affects only 20% of the rpoS
regulon.
In a previous experiment, prolonged stationary phase growth of a strain
carrying the rpoS819 allele resulted in the selection of a mutation in
another global regulator H-NS. Tinkering with a global regulator is the
fastest way to have rapid system-level changes. However, this also means
a global level imbalance which might require additional compensatory
change/s to reinstate the equilibrium. To test this hypothesis the
evolutionary trajectory/ies of a strain carrying the rpoS819 allele will
be traced by carrying out a laboratory evolution experiments. These
studies are in progress. <br> Understanding the diversity and dynamics of gut microbial
communities across developmental stages of butterflies </br><br>A major focus of research in biology is to understand 
mechanisms and processes that lead to the enormous diversity of 
life. Niche expansion onto new dietary resources is thought to 
be one of the factors driving diversification and speciation. A 
number of studies have demonstrated that gut microbial communities
of animals play a major role in determining resource use by aiding
digestion of complex nutrients, detoxification, provision of key
nutrients lacking in the diet, or by preventing gut infections.
Therefore, it is important to understand the impact of co-evolution
between animals and their gut microbial communities on the host 
ecology, evolution and behavior. Insects have proven to be 
excellent models to understand such co-evolutionary dynamics. Many 
studies on insects have demonstrated that diet and host physiology
 potentially influence the structure of the gut microbial 
communities. It is also established that insects with similar 
diets that belong to the same taxonomic group harbor similar 
microbial communities. However, the dietary habit not onlydiffers
across insect groups but in many cases within the lifetime of a
single insect. Butterflies are good examples that exhibit such a diet
switch, where larvae exclusively feed on leaves and adults on liquids such
as nectar. In addition, different butterfly species use different
resources in each feeding stage. We still lack a clear understanding
 of how microbial communities are shaped during these dietary
switches and developmental stages. In order to address this issue, I
propose to analyze the diversity and abundance of gut flora across
different developmental stages in different butterfly species. I also
intend to test whether manipulating the gut bacterial community
affects host butterfly fitness and how different bacterial communities
 are acquired during the lifetime of a butterfly. This work will 
lead to better understanding of the complex functional 
relationship between gut microbial communities and their insect hosts. <br> Understanding the role of Snail in stem cells. </br><br>Stem cells are undifferentiated, self renewing cells that
mediate tissue development and homeostasis. An evolving hypothesis is that
cancers also have a stem cell population which are involved in tumour
progression and relapse. However, the mechanisms involved in the induction
and maintenance of these stem cells are not known. One of the possible
mediators involved in this process is a zinc finger transcription factor,
Snail, known predominantly for its role in the induction of epithelial to
mesenchymal transition (EMT). Recent literature shows its upregulation in
most carcinomas, and its expression in cancer initiating cells. A
transgenic mouse designed to overexpress Snail in the skin shows cancer
associated phenotypes such as hyperplasia, inflammation, invasion and
increased angiogenesis. In addition to this, there is an expansion of the
niche harbouring the epithelial stem cells of the skin, suggesting that
there is an increase in the stem cell population triggered by the
overexpression of Snail. My project will focus on deciphering the role of
Snail in the induction and maintenance of stem cell features. Preliminary
data suggests that transgenic expression of Snail in keratinocytes is
sufficient to endow the cell with stem cell features. Previous work and
the microarray data suggest that this process can be initiated through
activation of STAT3, a factor implicated in regulating stemness. Based on
the preliminary data and recent study on nuclear architecture and stemness
another possible mechanism by which Snail induces and maintains stemness
could be by regulating genes associated with nuclear architecture of the
cell. I will be studying the contribution of each of these pathways to
Snail-mediated stemness. <br> The ecology of Alpine *Primula *communities in Sikkim Himalaya </br><br>Globally, high altitude regions of the world are experiencing
dramatic environment changes. As inhabitants of high elevation, alpine
plants are likely to experience these changes. Assessing the performance
of alpine plant species within and beyond their current elevation range
may help us understand how they will respond to environmental changes.
In my study, wide range (WR) and narrow (NR) range *Primula* species
(alpine flowering plant) were used to understand what limits the
distribution of these species. A reciprocal transplant experiment within
and beyond the native range of the species was carried out to species
changes outside their ranges. I will also briefly discuss the preliminary
results addressing the distribution, elevation limits and trait variation
between WR and NR* Primula* species. <br> Genetic Diversity Analysis, Genome-Wide Comparison And
Host-Pathogen Interaction Studies In Rice Blast Fungus Magnaporthe oryzae </br><br>The Indian subcontinent is the center of origin and diversity
for rice (Oryza sativa L). The O. sativa ssp. indica is a major food crop
grown in India, which occupies first and second position in area and
production, respectively. Blast disease caused by Ascomycetes fungal
pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae is a major constraint to rice production. The
fungus is also known to infect other food crops including wheat, finger
millet, barley and many grass species. Knowing the genome organization,
genetic diversity and population structure of Magnaporthe species is of
significant importance for designing blast management strategies, to
understand the evolution of virulent pathotypes and basis of host
shifts.The genome organization and genetic diversity of rice and non-rice
Magnaportheisolates from Indian subcontinenthas not been studied. In this
context, the broader objective of my research work is to study genetic
diversity of rice and non-rice Magnaporthe, followed by genome wide
comparison and host pathogen interaction studies.In this study,
Magnaporthe infecting rice and non-rice varieties were isolated from rice
and finger millet ecosystems from Karnataka during three consecutive wet
seasons of 2011, 2012 and 2013. The collection of Magnaporthe isolates was
studied using multi-marker system including, simple sequence repeats
(SSRs), repetitive DNA based markers (Pot2 and Grasshopper) and
pathogenicity genes. Phylogenetic analyses of Magnaporthe isolates
revealed the presence of multiple lineages and clustering based on
geographic location and host species. Furthermore, two of the SSR markers;
MGM246 and MGM286 were found to be rice specific and could distinguish
rice and non-rice isolates of Magnaporthe. The results also indicate the
possibility of active sexual recombination within different host limited
forms. Collective data from field sampling, molecular characterization
using SSR markers, repeat elements and pathogenicity genes presented an
evidence for high genetic diversity of Magnaporthe across different
hostspecies. The results of this study will set a platform for designing
resistance-breeding strategies for effective control of blast disease in
future. <br> Roles for histone and DNA methyltransferases in cervical cancer
cell migration </br><br>A large part of cancer associated mortality is due to
metastatic progression. One of the early stages of this complex process is
cell migration. Subsets of tumorigenic cells identified previously in our
lab show distinct gene expression profiles and enhanced invasive and
migratory abilities. I sought to identify chromatin players and their
roles in migratory ability in cervical cancer. An in vitro transwell
system,which allows the separation of migrated and non migrated cells, was
used. As transcription changes are an important outcome of epigenetic
regulation, a transcriptome profiling was done using RNA sequencing.
Migrated cells showed enrichment for cell migration, wound healing, and
DNA replication signatures, whereas non migrated cells showed enrichment
for cell death and interestingly, some migration initiation components.
The DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) was found to be enriched in the
migrated fraction at transcript and protein levels. Treatment with an
inhibitor to DNA methylation inhibited cell migration and was associated
with elevated levels of E-cadherin, a cell-cell adhesion molecule.
Another candidate epigenetic regulator, the histone methyltransferase
Suv39H1, as well as its associated histone mark, was found to be
downregulated in migrated cells. Migrated cells also showed larger nuclei,
and loss in global levels of both activation as well as repression
associated histone modification marks. Future directions seek to examine
whether Suv39H1 and DNMT1 play roles in cervical cancer migration and
other related phenotypes, the mechanisms involved, and for a possible
overlay with previously identified subsets of cells. <br> Biophysics of memory robustness in small biochemical reaction
systems </br><br>Memory formation in the brain is observed to correlate with a
Process known as synaptic plasticity, which involves structural and
biochemical changes localized in dendritic micro-structures called spines.
In chemical reaction networks, memory storage can physically be attained
by the family of multi-stable dynamical motifs. However, the spine
biochemistry is in a very small volume, and hence high noise regime. This
work attempts to look at robustness of memory in small topology bistable
systems, with respect to perturbations, in the form of noise and parametric
changes, and hence make predictions about biochemical constraints at the
dendritic spines. <br> Identification of novel inhibitors of the TLR-4 signaling pathway </br><br>Precise functioning and fine-tuning of Toll-like receptor 4
(TLR4) signaling is a critical requirement for the smooth functioning of
the innate immune system, since aberrant TLR4 activation causes excessive
production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferons. This can result
in life threatening conditions such as septic shock and other inflammatory
disorders. The TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) adaptor protein is
believed to be unique to the TLR4 signaling pathway and abrogation of
TRAM-mediated TLR4 signaling is a promising strategy for developing
therapeutics aimed at disrupting TRAM interactions with other components
of the TLR4 signaling complex. The VIPER motif from the vaccinia
virus-producing protein, A46 has been reported to disrupt TRAM-TLR4
interactions. We have exploited this information, in combination with
homology modelling and docking approaches, to identify a potential binding
site on TRAM lined by the BB loop and &#945;C helix. Virtual screening of
commercially available small molecules targeting the binding site enabled
to short-list 12 small molecules to abrogate TRAM-mediated TLR4 signaling.
In this AWS, I will explain the results of the experiments done to
validate the inhibitory activity of the shortlisted compounds,in
conjuction with molecular dynamic simulations of the protein-peptide and
protein-ligand complexes. <br> Analysis of factors affecting mate choice and variance in
reproductive success of lek-mating species Antilopecervicapra (Indian
Blackbuck) </br><br>Lek mating is a rare mating system in which males of a
speciesgather together on a common display ground (Lek) to attract
females.
Blackbucks are the only Indian mammal that show lek matingbehaviour. In
blackbucks, 90% of the matings occur in the centre of thelek, and hence
the system is believed to be highly polygynous. Using genetic tools, I aim
to understand this mating system, the factors that affect mate choice and
the degree of variance in reproductive success of the males.In the last
one year I have tried to develop genetic markers to address these
questions and collected faecal samples of males and juveniles from a
lekking population of blackbucks in Tal chhapar, Rajasthan. <br> Effects of Stress on Fear Learning and Fear Extinction </br><br>Classical auditory fear conditioning is a robust and efficient
form of associative learning that depends on the basolateral amygdale
(BLA). An attractive feature of this paradigm is that the fear memory that
is formed through pairing of conditioned (CS) (neutral stimulus) and
unconditioned stimuli (US) (aversive stimulus), can also be extinguished
after repeated presentations of the CS alone. While neurons in the BLA and
PL (prelimbic region of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)) encode the
acquisition and expression of fear memory respectively. The IL
(infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex) is involved in the acquisition of
extinction memory. Clinical studies have shown that stress causes enhanced
fear and impairs the ability to extinguish fear. Further, there is growing
evidence that chronic stress has contrasting effects on neurons in the BLA
and mPFC. Therefore it is interesting to know how stress disrupts the
balance between fear learning and extinction. To answer this we subjected
rats to an auditory fear conditioning and extinction paradigm. We observed
that stress causes an enhanced fear response and a delayed acquisition of
extinction memory. To know how these behavioral changes are related to the
activity in BLA and mPFC we performed LFP recordings from BLA, PL and IL
in behaving animals. I will be presenting some findings from this study. <br> Exploring the roles of CLIC/GEEC endocytosis during growth and
pattern formation in Drosophila </br><br>Physical-chemical processes varying as a function of space and
time are important in establishing concentration gradients across
developing tissues. Differential responses within a field of cells to
gradients of signalling molecules, or morphogens, are a function of both
cell autonomous and non autonomous properties. Wingless (Wg) forms exactly
such a gradient in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc. Previous work from
our lab has established that Wg signaling is potentiated only when two
processes of endocytosis function together in internalizing Wg via
CLIC/GEEC endocytosis and its receptor, Dfrizzled2, through
Clathrin-Dynamin dependent endocytosis.
My work aims at understanding how pattern formation scales according to
the size of a developing tissue. Scaling could occur by altering various
cell autonomous properties, such as the rates of endocytosis or
endocytosis mediated degradation across the tissue. In this annual work
seminar, I will discuss my experiments on roles of CLIC/GEEC endocytosis
in two contexts: patterning of Drosophila embryonic ventral ectoderm and
regulation of endocytosis in Drosophila wing and haltere imaginal discs. <br> Sequence and structure analysis of RNA-binding proteins in humans </br><br>RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are involved in the regulation of
various aspects of co- and post-transcriptional gene expression, including
RNA splicing, polyadenylation, capping, modification, export,
localization, translation and turnover. They are an extremely diverse
group of proteins, reflecting the diverse functional requirements of
cellular RNAs. So, precise molecular recognition between RNA elements and
protein residues is crucial. RNA sequence and structure collectively
influence protein recognition and binding. We have classified the
existing RBP structures, available in complex with RNA, into different
SCOP families and created Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). These
structure-centric family HMMs, along with sequence-centric family HMMs,
were used as a primary database to systematically search the human
proteome for the presence of putative RBPs. We have found more than 1500
gene products with RBP signatures in humans, of which 70% have no previous
experimental evidence for binding RNA.
In order to understand the functional differences amongst paralogs of
RNA-binding proteins in the human genome, an in-depth study has been
performed on the Transformer2 (Tra2) proteins in humans, which activate
splicing inclusion. A single Tra2 protein is conserved in fruit flies and
has two mammalian homologues called Tra2-&#945; and Tra2-&#946; which have
rather different gene structures, but produce very similar proteins.
However, there are no known endogenous targets of Tra2-&#945; and its
function is entirely unknown. Tra2-&#946; structure has been solved, but
not that of Tra2-&#945;. Here, we have modelled the structure of
Tra2-&#945; and compared its RNA binding specificities with that of
Tra2-&#946; using computational approaches. MD simulations show that the
two proteins have differential binding affinities towards the same RNA. We
are presently performing binding energy calculations to resolve the
conflict as to whether the two paralogs exist as a redudancy or
robustness. <br> Understanding the molecular mechanisms of fibroblasts activation
in a mouse model of skin fibrosis </br><br>Fibrosis is a hallmark of many chronic diseases, such as
scleroderma and cancer and a major contributor to the morbidity and
mortality associated with them. Fibroblasts are the key players in the
pathophysiology of all fibrotic diseases. The central events in the
pathogenesis of fibrosis are localized migration, recruitment,
proliferation and differentiation of fibroblasts into activated
fibroblasts (myofibroblasts). These activated fibroblasts secrete excess
extracellular matrix and cause tissue contracture, and together these
result in tissue hardening leading toorgan failure. Despite the enormous
clinical burden fibrotic diseases impose, the signaling cascades/molecular
pathways that initiate fibrosis and its progression remain elusive. Our
lab has engineered a transgenic mouse which expresses the transcription
factor Snail in the epidermis (Snail Tg) that exhibits all the hallmarks
of dermal fibrosis. Contrary to current paradigms, the Snail mediated
fibrosis was not a consequence of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition. 
Instead we found that Snail expressing keratinocytes secrete proteins that
can cause fibroblast activation. Among the proteins that are exclusively
secreted by Snail expressing keratinocytes is Mindin (Spondin2). I have
shown that both Snail and Mindin are overexpressed in a fibrotic skin
disease, scleroderma. My studies, on the molecular role of Mindin in
tissue fibrosis suggests that Mindin affects fibroblast migration and
their differentiation into myofibroblasts. Moreover, I found that Src
family kinases (SFKs) mediate fibroblasts migration on Mindin treatment.
My work currently focuses on delineating which SFK member (Src/Fyn/Yes) is
involved in mediating the effects of Mindin on fibroblasts.
. <br> The molecular mechanism of the prion protein misfolding and
oligomerization </br><br>Prion is a GPI-anchored protein present ubiquitously in brain
cells of mammals. The autocatalytic conversion of the cellular prion
protein, PrPC, into the misfolded and aggregated form, PrPSc, is linked to
several fatal neurodegenerative diseases.Several lines of evidence
indicate that soluble oligomers rather than amyloid fibrils are the
neurotoxic species. But the molecular mechanism of formation of these
oligomers, especially the early structural changes, is poorly understood.
Several disease-linked mutations in PrP appear to increase the likelihood
of neurodegeneration. An understanding of how different disease-linked
mutations affect the structure and dynamics of native monomeric PrP can
provide a clue about how misfolding commences. The structure of PrPC is
known from NMR studies to consist of an unstructured N-terminal domain and
a structured C-terminal domain comprising 3 alpha-helices and 2 short
beta-strands.In this study, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry
was used to show that several disease-linked mutant variants, which are
thermodynamically destabilized, share a common structural perturbation in
their native states: helix 1 is destabilized to an extent that correlates
well with the destabilization of the native protein. The mutant variants
misfold and form oligomers faster than does the wt protein, at rates that
increase exponentially with the extent to which helix 1 is destabilized in
the native protein. These studies therefore suggest that the loss of helix
1 structure, most likely because of its movement away from helices 2 and
3, marks the beginning of PrP misfolding and oligomerization. <br> Studying the Representations of Sensory Stimuli in the Mouse
Hippocampus </br><br>The mammalian hippocampus is considered important in the
formation of new memories about experienced events (episodic or
autobiographical memory), general declarative memory (memories that can be
explicitly verbalized), spatial memory and navigation, and associations
between stimuli that are distinct in time, among other functions. To
achieve this, the Hippocampus must integrate information from different
sensory areas of the cortex.
My project deals with studying the spatio-temporal dynamics
ofstimulus-evoked representations in the Hippocampal CA1 neurons. I
monitor calcium activity from a large number of CA1 neurons (>100) by
Two-Photon Imaging, with cellular resolution. Finally, my experiments
attempt to control the behavioural state of the animals, a factor known to
affect the activity of these cells.
In this presentation, I shall discuss my progress in the three arms of the
project.
 1. Acute measurements with na??ve animals exposed to stimuli (tone and
whisker-puff). I do not observe clear responses to tone. We suspect that
the behavioural relevance of the stimulus is important here.
2. Designing a training paradigm to control the behaviour state of the
animals. Here, I train water-deprived mice to ignore a ???No-Go??? tone
and respond to a ???Go??? tone (different frequency) with a lick
(reinforced through a water reward). I observe that behavioural
performance improves only after several days of training.
 3. Standardizing a chronic preparation to measure the activity of the
same cells over several days. Here, I have been able to get GCaMP, a
genetically encoded calcium indicator, to express in the CA1 cells.
Studying stimulus representation could provide a basic framework to
understanding the mechanisms followed when hippocampus dependent
associations are made. <br> Role of the clathrin independent CLIC/GEEC (CG) endocytic pathway
in membrane homeostasis </br><br>Eukaryotic cells have multiple endocytic pathways that help
internalize nutrients, ligands, receptors and extracellular fluid.
Endocytic pathways and subsequent recycling are also important for rapid
membrane redistribution during processes such as cell spreading, mitosis
and cell migration. Cells need to tightly coordinate membrane exchange
through these endo-exocytic processes for the maintenance of its plasma
membrane area and cell shape. Membrane tension has been thought to play a
role in coordinating the exo-endocytic delivery of membrane to and from
the cell surface. However, the nature of the endocytic pathway(s),
molecules or mechanism(s) behind these regulated processes remains largely
unknown. Unlike the extensively studied clathrin mediated endocytic
pathway, clathrin independent endocytic (CIE) pathways, in particular the
CLIC/GEEC (CG) pathway could serve as a central player in the homeostasis
of membrane tension or area. The CG pathway is a high capacity CIE
pathway that internalize the equivalent of entire PM area in 12 minutes.
The CG pathway also rapidly regurgitates a major fraction of endocytosed.
These properties give it the potential to be a core regulator of membrane
dynamics thatcould also respond to membrane tension.
Here we have explored the role of multiple endocytic pathways in mammalian
cells during de-adhering or upon changing tension using a stretching
device or osmotic changes. We find that CG endocytic pathway is
specifically up-regulated during de-adhering while caveolar or clathrin
mediated endocytic pathways are unaffected. Changing membrane tension by
stretching or osmotic changes also triggers similar response from CG
pathway. Modulating the CG pathway appear to modify the membrane tension,
indicating the pathway could help set the resting membrane tension or
maintain area homeostasis of a cell. <br> Genomics to explore population structure in tigers in the Indian
Landscape </br><br>Tigers are estimated to currently occupy a mere 7% of their
historical range globally. Populations are relatively small and patchily
distributed. Identifying genetic clusters is necessary to understand
demographic history and to study connectivity between populations. Genomic
approaches using SNP markers, as opposed to traditional microsatellite
markers, can help reveal fine-scale population structure. Single
Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data provide independent bits of information
from potentially thousands of loci, allowing greater access to the genome.
In the past year, I have been working to develop genome-wide SNP markers
to understand population subdivision in Bengal tigers, across their
distribution in India. To do this, the double-digestion Restriction-site
Associated DNA sequencing method (Peterson et al, 2012) was used to
identify SNPs in the tiger genome. From the analysis so far, we find that
SNP markers perform better in identifying genetic subdivision. In this
AWS, I will present the progress made in this direction. <br> Probing the sub-millisecond events during protein folding </br><br>Studying the early events during the folding reaction is
important, since these events set the stage for the actual folding
transition. In the current study the sub-millisecond events during the
folding of a small protein Monellin from the guanidine hydrochloride
denatured state was studied by using a custom made microsecond mixing,
continuous flow setup with a mixing dead time of 35 ?s. The sub
millisecond folding reaction was studied by different probes such as
intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, multi-site FRET, ANS fluorescence and
IAEDANS fluorescence. The initial collapse transition which results in
compaction of the polypeptide chain is complete within the mixing dead
time of the mixer. The compaction event manifests itself as an increase in
FRET efficiency for all the three segments studied, a blue shift and an
increase in quantum yield of tryptophan and an increase in the
fluorescence quantum yield of IAEDANS moiety attached to the protein. The
collapse state has hydrophobic patches already formed that can bind
extrinsic fluorophore ANS. All these events are over within 1 ms of
initiation of folding reaction where the secondary structure is yet to
form. This study brings out the non-cooperative nature of the
sub-millisecond folding events. <br> Role of gap junctions in synaptogenesis and dendritic
arborization. </br><br>Gap junctions are intercellular channels that allow the
passage of ions and small molecules between the cells. In the nervous
system, these junctions are responsible for electrical coupling of the
cells. Gap junctions in vertebrates are made up of protein subunits called
connexins. To address the role of gap junctions in synaptogenesis and
dendritic arborization, I am looking at connexin35, a neuronal connexin
isoform in fish. It has previously been shown in the lab that connexin35
is abundant in the cerebellum and shows punctate labeling. My work shows
the presence of Cx35 on Purkinje neurons, a distinctive cell type of the
cerebellum. Also dye coupling in these cells shows that these gap
junctions are indeed functional. To perturb Cx35 levels, we have
previously designed Splice-blocking morpholino (SBMO) in the lab which
leads to the mis-splicing of the Cx35 mRNA. In my presentation I will be
showing some of my preliminary results quantifying the Cx35 protein levels
in the control and SBMO injected larvae. I will also discuss the approach
that I will be using in future for quantification of my results. <br> Critical Period for olfactory habituation in Drosophila </br><br>Habituation is a decreased response to a repeated/ constant
stimulus. When flies are exposed to an odorant for 4 days they habituate
to it. Behavioral habituation is accompanied by increase in volume of the
area of the brain that responds to this odorant. But this is only
observed if the odor exposure is started within 12 hrs of the flies coming
out of the pupa case. Older flies don?t habituate or show this volume
increase. We find an increase in the dendrites of the neurons which carry
odorant information from the antennal lobe (which processes olfactory
information in the fly) to higher processing centres in the fly brain. The
increase in dendrites of these neurons (called Projection neurons or PNs)
is only observed in younger flies and not in older flies. I am trying to
find the other cell types that contribute to the volume increase and the
mechanisms that block plasticity in these cells in older flies. <br> Exploring excited state dynamics of Sandercyanin Fluorescent
Protein (SFP) by time-resolved fluorescence and X-ray crystallography </br><br>Sandercyanin, a blue bilin- binding protein from blue
walleye(Sander vitreus), is a far- red &#64258;uorescent protein that
shows interesting fluorescent properties including a large Stoke shift and
enhanced infrared fluorescence on binding to biliverdin. Crystal structure
of wild-type Sandercyanin shows that it is a homo-tetramer of 81kDa and
binds biliverdin non-covalently to each monomer. Biliverdin- induced
tetramerization and structure of biliverdin- bound SFP monomers have
already been discussed previously. Recently, we attempted to understand
the excited state dynamics of SFP using femtosecond time- resolved
fluorescence spectroscopy. We found evidence of excited state proton
transfer (ESPT) by H/D exchange and pH studies which would be discussed in
details. Further, we are interested in exploring the structural changes of
Sandercyanin in its excited state using time-resolved crystallography. <br> Spatial and Temporal Effects of Immobilisation Stress in Rats </br><br>Stress has debilitating effects on an organism, having both
spatial and temporal impacts on the system. In both human patients and
animal models of stress disorders, the amygdala shows an upregulation in
structure and function with stress, while the hippocampus and medial
prefrontal cortex shows a down regulation of the same. Evidences hint at a
possible regulatory role of the amygdala in controlling stress effects on
these latter two regions, and to test this hypothesis, I have performed a
pharmacological inactivation experiment in a rodent model of chronic
stress. In parallel, a one-time, acute exposure to stress has also been
shown to increase anxiety in rodents. This increase, interestingly, is
evident only after a time delay after stress exposure. A therapeutically
relevant question therefore, would be to intervene after stress exposure
to try and reverse the effects of stress. To this end, I did a
pharmacological intervention study in an acute stress model to find this
post-stress therapeutic window. In my AWS, I will be talking about my
progress in answering both these questions. <br> Dynamics of Emergent Structures in an Active Polar Fluid </br><br>The cortex of eukaryotic cells is a thin film of actin
filaments, myosin motors and related proteins that is driven strongly out
of equilibrium by the consumption of ATP. The generation of stresses and
flows at the microscopic level leads to novel collective behaviour.
Focusing on the regime in which it is appropriate to model a subset of
filaments in the cortex as a fluid material, we construct a minimal
coarse-grained theory of actin filaments and myosin motors. From this, we
find that actomyosin self-assembles into a set of clusters that can be
either mobile or static. Their form, dynamics and interactions are
explored, and we describe the first steps towards the construction of an
effective theory of these emergent structures that may prove useful in
probing the role of actomyosin in the spatiotemporal regulation of cell
surface organisation.
. <br> Growth phase-dependent regulation of the E. coli RNA polymerase </br><br>A bacterial cell must be able to regulate its gene expression
in response to changes in the environment. Initiation of transcription by
the bacterial RNA polymerase is the major point at which gene expression
is regulated. Sigma (??) factors bind to the RNA polymerase and direct it
to
initiate transcription from specific promoters. Any change in the cellular
level of RNA polymerase, its availability for transcription, or its
partitioning between different sigma factors should translate into a
rapid, coordinated change in global gene expression, and so the regulation
of RNA
polymerase is an important means of responding to environmental change. In
the model bacterium E. coli, it is known that in a rapidly dividing
population, the sigma factor ??70 binds to RNA polymerase and directs it
to transcribe its targets, which include proliferation-related genes. When
the population enters stationary phase, transcription of ??70 target genes
is reduced, and transcription becomes largely directed by the alternative
sigma factor ??38, whose targets include multiple stress tolerance genes.
I will present data from an RNA-Seq experiment combined with theoretical
modeling to understand how two molecules - the ??70 sequestering protein
Rsd and the non-coding 6S RNA - regulate this growth phase-dependent
change in the activity of RNA polymerase. <br> Coexistence of active phases and their cellular implications </br><br>Coexisting equilibrium phases of matter are characterized by
mechanical, chemical and thermodynamic balance conditions both in the bulk
and at the interface. These conditions lead to relations between the
intensive quantities in the two phases, such as equality of temperature,
chemical potentials, and the Young-Laplace equation for force balance .
Dynamical description of the phases away from equilibrium have been given
by generalizing the single phase non equilibrium thermodynamics by
including the boundary conditions at the interface. The aim of this work
we will generalize the bulk and interface conditions to the case of two
coexisting active fluid phases. This formal study of coexistence of active
phases is motivated by the various observations showing existence of
macroscopic non-membrane bound structures in the cell. In many of these
cases it has been suggested that the structures are fluid like and ATP
dependent. Large scale lipid
segregation within cell membrane, chromosome territories and nucleoli in
nucleoplasm are some of the examples. <br> Drosophila Septin7,Pnut modulates functional coupling of dSTIM
and dOrai and store-operated Ca2+ entry in neurons. </br><br>Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) is a conserved mechanism for
uptake of extracellular Ca2+ in to cells. Binding of extracellular ligands
to both cell surface G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and Receptor
Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) results in generation of the second messenger
inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 subsequently binds to and opens
IP3 receptors (IP3R) on the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
allowing depletion of the ER Ca2+ stores. The reduction in ER store Ca2+
is sensed by STIM proteins , which subsequently cluster and move to
regions of close apposition between the ER and the plasma membrane(PM),
where they directly bind to and open the Ca2+ release activated Ca2+
(CRAC) channel, Orai, allowing uptake of extracellular Ca2+ . Septins are
a class of GTP binding proteins that form linear non-polar filaments in
cells. Mammalian septins SEPT2, SEPT4 and SEPT5 act as coordinators of
SOCE in HeLa and T cells. SEPT2 participates with SEPT6 and SEPT7 in
formation of septin filaments. We wanted to understand if the role of
septins as regulators of SOCE is conserved between non-excitable cells and
excitable cells like neurons. In my earlier AWS,I provided evidence in
support of a role for Drosophila septin7, Pnut in regulation of SOCE in
neurons. Pnut reduction compensated for reduced IP3R function in neurons
of the Drosophila flight circuit. Investigations of cellular Ca2+
homeostasis revealed that Pnut reduction failed to improve reduced IP3
stimulated Ca2+ release through the mutant IP3R but significantly restored
SOCE in neurons , suggesting that Pnut regulates events downstream of IP3R
activation and store Ca2+ depletion. Depletion of the ER store Ca2+
results in recruitment of STIM to regions of close proximity between the
ER and the PM, where it can functionally couple to and open the Orai
channel. We therefore investigated if this functional coupling of dSTIM
and dOrai is regulated Pnut levels. Earlier work from our lab showed that
physical interaction between dSTIM and dOrai after store depletion is
significantly reduced in IP3R mutant neurons (Sumita Chakraborty, PhD
thesis, 2014).In this AWS, I will present an imaging based quantification
of the store depletion induced dSTIM/dOrai coupling at the cell surface. I
will also show how improvement in this coupling might be one of the
molecular mechanisms underlying the restoration of SOCE seen on reducing
Pnut levels in neurons with reduced IP3R function. <br> Effects of atmospheric nutrient deposition on tropical dry forest
tree seedlings </br><br>Human activities have resulted in accelerated rates of
atmospheric nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) deposition across ecosystems
globally. The increased availability of these essential plant nutrients
have the potential to affect vegetation productivity and diversity in a
number of ecosystems through changes in individual plant growth, as well
as, altering the susceptibility of plants to disturbance. Most research in
this field has focussed on temperate ecosystems and there exists very
little information on how tropical ecosystems will respond to N and P
deposition. Here I present results from a pot or common garden experiment
which investigated the effect of N and P fertilisation on seedlings of
multiple tropical dry forest tree species commonly found in India.
Specifically, I will assess changes in seedling above- and below-ground
biomass accumulation in response to fertilisation, as these are key traits
in determining seedling susceptibility to fire, which is an important
disturbance agent in this ecosystem. The analysis will aim to identify
general patterns in the responses of species used in the experiment
aggregated into two functional groups ? N fixers and non-N fixers - which
differ in their nutrient requirement and uptake strategies. Lastly,
predictions from the pot experiment will be explored using preliminary
results from a recently concluded field experiment, where seedlings from
multiple dry forest tree species were exposed to N and P fertilisation, as
well as fire. <br> *ydaS*-RacR : Another Toxin antitoxin in E.coli-K12 MG1655? </br><br>Rac is one of the nine - horizontally acquired - cryptic
prophages in *E.coli-K12* and has 29 genes (23kbp in length). Deletion of
racR, from this prophage is lethal, however the entire prophage can be
deleted. My study aims to reveal the molecular basis of the observed
phenotype. We hypothesized that racR could be the repressor of a toxin. As
a first step in understanding the mechanism underlying this process, we
have found that racR binds to the intergenic regulatory region that is
common between both racR and *ydaS. *However, the mechanism of repression
and toxicity is yet to be revealed. <br> Bioinformatics survey of dwarf Asian honey bee (Apis florea)
genome for olfactory receptors </br><br>The mechanism of smell perception of environmental chemicals
involves binding of chemicals to olfactory/odorant receptors (ORs). The
high number of odorants and ORs form the basis of combinatorial code of
smell perception, which is not completely understood yet. I initially
contributed in this direction in the update of Database of Olfactory
Receptors (DOR), which houses sequence, phylogeny and structural
information of ORs from five model organisms. With the aim of the
expansion of DOR, next, a genome-wide survey was performed in newly
sequenced dwarf Asian honey bee (Apis florea) for ORs. Similarities in the
glomerular organisation of the antennal lobes in A. florea and European
honey bee A. mellifera, lead to the hypothesis of similar set of receptors
in both of them. We tested the same by performing bioinformatics genome
wide survey (GWS) of ORs in A. florea by restructuring of the existing
genes and discovery of a few novel ones. I will be discussing the
bioinformatics pipeline used for this GWS and further elaborate on the
interesting trends observed in motif prediction, transmembrane helix
prediction, pseudogene numbers and syntenic organization. Such results
will lead to the phylogenetic analysis of A. florea ORs with the ORs from
three more honey bee species, A. mellifera, A. cerana and A. dorsata. This
analysis poses new questions regarding the honey bee physiology and
behaviour, few of which will be addressed in the future. <br> A Metabolomics approach to investigate planaria regeneration </br><br>In recent times, there has been a renewed interest in the role
of metabolism in stem cell maintenance and differentiation. Notable among
them is preference of stem cells to aerobic glycolysis rather than the
more energy efficient oxidative phosphorylation for energy production.
Likewise in many cancers, the end products of metabolic pathways (like
lactate) are replenished back to nutrients (pyruvate or glucose by eg.
liver) are known to maintain its proliferation. These findings are
collectively but loosely defined as 'Metabolic Reprogramming'.
In contrast to cell culture based approach, studies on a whole organism
such as planaria can provide detailed insights regarding the bodily source
of nutrients, how the metabolic end products of stem cells can be
replenished/re-charged and its role in stem cell maintenance. I am using
planaria regeneration as an in-vivo model system to study metabolic
reprogramming involved in regeneration. My study provides evidences
metabolic reprogramming in planaria stem cells while they are
differentiating. Further, the role of metabolites and their pathways are
determined using mass spectrometry. <br> Investigation of the phylogeny and dynamics of 3D domain-swapping
in Serpins. </br><br>For my Ph.D. work, phylogenetic and evolutionary studies were
used to get insights on the functional regulatory mechanisms concerned
with Isocitrate Dehydrogenases(IDH). Molecular dynamics was used to gauge
correlations in dynamic properties from sample structures of IDHs
with their functions and evolutionary position in phylogeny. During my
postdoctoral tenure, I propose a similar technique to understand the
functioning and the misfolding aspects in the Serpin family of proteins.
Some serpins form 3D-domain swapped structures due to mutations or
external conditions. Two different forms of 3D-domain swapped serpin
structures are known, from human antitrypsin and antithrombin. The
functioning and 3D-domain swapping aspects of serpins seem interlinked. A
Molecular Dynamics study of the functional, latent and the 3Ddomain
swapped structures can give insights into the formation of these
structures. The possibility of occurance of such domain swapping in other
serpins may also be gauged by a phylogenetic study of the serpin family.

Seminar by BERI Early Career Award applicant:
3. <br> What?s that racket? From drongos to acoustic landscapes. </br><br>The study of acoustic landscapes holds great potential as a tool
for monitoring changes in biodiversity. The varied vocal repertoires of
birds provide cues for species identification, and at the same time pose a
challenge to the development of tools for their
automated song recognition. Based on previous work on automated algorithms
for identifying and quantifying avian vocal mimicry, this proposal
outlines an interdisciplinary approach to develop such tools, which
includes collaborations between biologists, engineers and citizen
science. This project aims to create a framework for automated acoustic
diversity measurement that is supported by background data generated
through citizen science. Such a framework will also act as a unique tool
for biodiversity management, education and conservation.

Time : 11:00 am <br> How to make a vesicle without a protein coat? </br><br>Eukaryotic cells employ multiple endocytic routes to
internalize cell surface receptors, nutrients, membrane proteins/lipids
and extracellular fluid. Clathrin Dependent (CD) endocytic pathways are
studied extensively, but clathrin independent endocytic pathways are
emerging to have critical roles in many cellular processes. The Clathrin
Independent Carriers/GPI-AP Enriched Endosomal Compartments (CLIC/GEEC;
CG) pathway, regulated by small GTPases such as CDC42 and ARF1 .CG
pathway internalizes major fraction of fluid and is responsible for a
significant fraction of the plasma membrane turnover in fibroblasts. In
the absence of any discernible coat electron dense (clathrin) and a
scission machine (dynamin), the structural components that assist in CG
vesicle generation are poorly understood.
To find molecules which could assist in CG endosome formation we have
focused our attention on BAR domain proteins. The BAR domain family
proteins contain a curvature sensing/stabilization domain along with
accessory domains. These accessory domains help in localization via
binding to lipids, influencing actin around them, or recruit other
proteins to the site of vesicle generation.
We performed a dsRNA screen against all the Drosophila BAR domain
containing proteins and have found a few hits influencing the CG pathway.
Among them we are exploring the role of a singular BAR domain protein
involved in endocytosis, the PICK1 protein (protein interacting with PRKCA
1). PICK1 is a known negative regulator of ARP2/3 mediated actin
polymerization. We find that both PICK1 and ARP2/3 inhibition affects CG
endocytosis. They are also recruited to newly scissioned endosomes in an
orchestrated fashion. We are currently trying to understand how PICK1 and
ARP2/3 intersect to affect CG endocytosis. <br> Evolution, bird song and conservation of sky island birds </br><br>Sky islands are a form of island system formed by an
interaction of topography and climate. These are islands of montane
habitats isolated by valleys of inhospitable habitats. Species in these
mountain-tops are often highly specialized to such habitats. The sky
islands in the Western Ghats are a linear island system with different
levels of patchiness ? mountains isolated by valleys, montane habitat on
the mountains isolated by anthropogenic fragmentation, and at the smallest
scale, natural shoal forest patches isolated by natural grasslands. In
previous AWS talks I have described biogeography results from our genetic
explorations for all Shola birds across the mountains. I also described
the fine-scale genetic differentiation in one species revealing an
island-within-island effect due to deforestation. In this AWS, I will
provide an overview of three different lines of research - the origins of
Western Ghat birds, the discovery of an endemic radiation and two new bird
genera, and song differences across populations of one bird species. <br> Structural and Biochemical characterization of MsDpo4 from
Mycobacterium smegmatis </br><br>Members of the Y-family of DNA polymerases (dPols) are
critical for the rescue of the replication stalled at damaged nucleotides.
In addition, prokaryotic members of this family have been shown to
participate in the stress induced mutagenesis to facilitate adaptation and
relieve selection imposed by the environment. MsDpo4 is a Y-family dPol
from Mycobacterium smegmatis and, sequence and structural analysis
suggested that this enzyme may be endowed with unique properties. DNA
polymerases have bulky aromatic residues at their active site, which forms
a steric gate for selection of deoxyribonucleotides. The steric gate is
absent in MsDpo4 and this enzyme is capable of incorporating
ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides. Using different DNA substrates,
I have attempted to discern the importance of this activity in DNA repair
and translesion synthesis. The progress made in this direction will be
presented. <br> Role of Poly (A) binding Protein Nuclear (PABPN) in Planarian
Regeneration. </br><br>The planarian Schmidtea mediterranea with its high regenerative
ability is emerging as a powerful model organism. Neoblast are the adult
somatic stem cells which give rise to all the cell types of the organism
and these are found to be responsible for their impressive regenerative
ability. Various RNA binding proteins (RBPs) play critical role in
regulating gene expression patterns. Poly A binding protein nuclear 1
(PABPN1) is an RNA binding protein which interacts with polyadenylation
polymerase (PAP) and Cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor (CPSF)
for the polyA tail synthesis of pre mRNA. In mammals PABPN1 is widely
expressed in muscles; depletion/abnormality of the protein leads to
oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD). Transcriptomic analysis of
pabpn in planaria reveals neoblast specific expression pattern. Further,
RNA interference studies showed phenotypic defects like blotting,
immobility and insensitivity towards light suggesting a role of the
protein in regenerative processes. Immunostaining and quantitative PCR
showed defects in stem cell proliferation and differentiation along with
disorganization of muscle fibers and photoreceptor abnormalities. These
studies implicates specific role of pabpn during the course of
regeneration in planarian. <br> Responses of descending interneurons to mechanical and visual
stimuli in Oleander hawk moths </br><br>Flying insects rely on multisensory feedback to stabilize their
flight. The insect's response to sensory input has to be quick, usually of
the order of a wingstroke, to maintain stable flight. Among various
sensory feedbacks, visual input is critical for flight control. In
hawkmoths, antennal mechanosensory input has been shown to be necessary
for normal flight (Sane et al 2007). In the absence of this input, the
moth is unable to maintain normal flight. Sensory inputs from all these
various sensory modalities (like vision and antennae) have to eventually
reach the flight muscles to make the necessary changes to control flight.
Sherman and Dickinson (2004) have shown in Drosophila that the response to
external perturbation is a weighted sum of visual input and mechanosensory
input. However, the neural circuitry responsible for integration of these
multiple sensory inputs is not known. Given that the response to sensory
inputs has to be of the order of a wingstroke, we hypothesize that the
neural circuitry responding to these multiple sensory inputs is small.
More interestingly, within this small neural circuit, single neurons
possibly combine multisensory inputs before transmitting it to the flight
muscles to decrease delay in response.
In my project, we are addressing this question, by recording
ntracellularly in the neck region, the responses of descending
interneurons to various mechanical and visual stimuli in the nocturnal
moth _Daphnis nerii_ (Oleander hawk moth). We find that there are neurons
which respond to both mechanosensory and visual stimuli. In my previous
AWS, I had shown pilot data from ongoing experiments. In this AWS, I will
show the data I have collected so far, some preliminary analysis and
discuss future work. <br> The expression of CD49 in the context of CD66+ cells, marks the
cellular phenotypes linked to Human invasive cervical cancer progression </br><br>A major area of concern in the cancer treatment is the tumour
recurrence after the apparent complete removal of cancerous cells by
chemo-radio therapy. This might be because of the subset of chemo-radio
resistant cells which have self renewal property and ability to migrate
and spread increasing the tumour burden. Both the basic biology and
therapeutic management of recurrent/progressive cervical cancers is poorly
understood. We are interested in the nature of distinct cellular sub-sets
that may be critical to cervical cancer progression and our recent work
has delineated a sub-set of CD66+ with increased tumorigenic and invasive
properties. In this study we are exploring if there is heterogeneity
within the CD66 sub population? Are there supporting cells (tumour/normal)
cells which are required for migration of CD66+ cells .We are focusing on
using other surface markers such as CD49f, to better understand
transitions from invasive cervical cancer to metastasis. We are trying to
integrate clinical information with the use of established cell lines to
make a coherent model. Spheroids of cervical cancer cell line CaSki when
embedded in matrigel forms collectively invading protrusions with distinct
leading and trailing cells. CD66+CD49f- acts as the major subset involved
in cellular migration but is aided by the low number of leading edge
CD66-CD49f+ cells. Therefore migration of CD66 subset is supported by
other cells which may be involved in remodelling the tumour
microenvironment in such a way that it can create a milieu which enables
the migration of CD66 +ve cells. <br> Cooperation and antagonism of transport systems in the uptake of
galactose in Escherichia coli </br><br>Gene transcription is regulated by proteins called
transcription factors (TFs), giving rise to transcriptional networks.
Networks regulating sugar metabolism in E. coli are amongst the most
well-documented ones, especially the galactose network. This network
consists of two TF genes, galR and galS, regulating two transporter genes,
galP and mglB. E. coli are not alone in possessing such a network. A
majority of enterobacterial species employ a similar two TF-two
transporter network to metabolize galactose. Our work focuses on
estimating the relative advantage of such a two-transporter system, if
any, as well as understanding how two TFs are employed in
regulating the relative concentrations of each transporter.
 To study these questions, we built a dynamic model of the E. coli
galactose network that estimates the growth rate of an E. coli
population, based on the amount of galactose present in their
environment, and the interactions within the galactose network. While
both GalP and MglB are present in the E. coli membrane simultaneously,
the amount of galactose flowing through them changes depending on the
growth phase of the E. coli population. Further, we find that
transport through MglB inhibits galactose transport through GalP. A
consequence of this inhibition is that naively combining GalP and
MglB in the same cell would give only a modest increase in galactose
transport, unless transporter expression is appropriately regulated by
GalR and GalS. We find this to be the case - MglB is expressed in
greater numbers when environmental galactose concentrations are low,
while GalP production increases only in a relatively rich galactose
environment. <br> Tuning Cooperativity on the Free Energy Landscape of Protein Folding </br><br>The folding reactions of proteins are envisaged to occur on a
complex multi-dimensional free energy landscape, traversing several local
minima, before reaching the global minimum i.e. the native state.These
reactions maybe slowed down by a continuum of small (~ kBT) free energy
barriers or by a few large (> 3 kBT) free energy barriers. The aim of the
present work was to gain insight onto the mechanism by which a protein
explores the free energy landscape during a folding or unfolding
reaction.The free energy surface accessible to a small protein, monellin,
was characterized by hydrogen exchange coupled to mass spectrometry. Under
native conditions (no denaturant) the unfolding transition was observed to
be entirely gradual. The addition of mild amounts of denaturant, still
maintaining largely native-like conditions, resulted in a barrier limited
unfolding transition. In this talk I will be presenting these results
which show that barrier-limited folding/unfolding reactions can be tuned
by changes in the stabilities of the native and the unfolded states to
become barrierless. <br> Speeding up PI(4,5)P2 recovery with top gear </br><br>Fastest G protein coupled reaction known to human is
invertebrate phototransduction. During Drosophila melanogaster
phototransduction, Phosphatidylinositol -4, 5- bisphosphate (PIP2) levels
on the plasma membrane plays a vital role in transmitting visual cues into
electric response. Levels of PIP2 and other lipid intermediates should be
tightly regulated for normal phototransduction. This intriguing regulation
has raised interesting questions which we can confront with the help of
experimental as well as theoretical approaches. In search of these
answers, previously we have shown that various minimal mathematical models
were unable to explain fast PIP2 dynamics as well as various lipid
intermediate steady state level. We extended our analysis by adding
various kinds of feedback into our minimal mathematical model. Our in
silico analysis suggests that feedback control is essential to speed up
PIP2 recovery after light stimulation. Predictions from our mathematical
model have lead us to carry out biochemical experiments that might
validate our understanding about regulation of PIP2 during
phototransduction. <br> Structural mechanism of Ub/NEDD8 dysfunction caused by Cif family
deamidases </br><br>Cycle Inhibiting factors (Cifs) are a family of bacterial
deamidases produced by diverse pathogenic bacteria via the type III
secretion system. Cifs are ?cyclomodulins? that inhibit the eukaryotic
host cell cycle and also hijack other key cellular processes such as those
controlling the actin network and apoptosis. Cif (from enteropathogenic E.
coli) and its homolog CHBP (from B. pseudomallei) impair the ubiquitin
proteasome system through the glutamine deamidation of NEDD8/Ubiquitin at
position 40.
 Ubiqutination is a three step cascade involving E1, E2 and E3 enzymes
that catalyse the formation of E1~Ub, E2~Ub and substrate~Ub conjugates
respectively. A previous study has shown that the deamidation of
glutamine 40 by CHBP does not affect the formation of E1~Ub and E2~Ub
conjugates but instead impairs the transfer of Ub onto the substrate. We
seek to understand the structural mechanism underlying this observed
defect using a combination of all atom-molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
and in vitro ubiquitination assays. I will be presenting key preliminary
insights obtained from molecular dynamics simulations that shed light on
Ub Q40E dysfunction. These insights will serve as the basis of guiding
future experiments. In addition, we also wish to understand structural
mechanism of NEDD8 Q40E dysfunction. Hence, I will also discuss possible
MD-based approaches to begin addressing this aspect of the problem. <br> Studying Purkinje neurons during motor adaptation. </br><br>The cerebellum is a brain structure critical for motor
learning and is therefore highly conserved across vertebrates. Purkinje
neurons (PNs) in the cerebellum play key roles during motor learning and
are known to participate in motor error detection i.e. when the sensory
information following a motor command does not match. It has been
hypothesized that the cells do so by integrating multi modal sensory
information from Parallel fibres (PF) and precisely timed error
information from Climbing fibres (CF).The theories regarding the role of
PNs during motor adaptation, so far, have only been addressed through in
vitro electrophysiology, animal behavioural studies or theoretical
modeling. Thezebrafish cerebellum provides a unique system to study
invivo cellular physiology and population activity in an awake behaving
animal. Zebrafish larvae show stereotypic motor output to optic flow
called the optomotor response where they move in the direction of the
moving stimuli to stabilize their position with respect to the
surrounding. Using a closed loop paradigm where the visual stimulus
changes according to the larva?s fictive motor pattern, one can study the
neural correlates of error detection and compensation i.e. motor
adaptation. The present study provides the first detailed
electrophysiological description of zebrafish Purkinje neurons. We show
that PNs in zebrafish show similarities to mammalian PNs as well as those
of mormyrid fish. These neurons spontaneously show simple spikes and
calcium spikes. CF inputs in these PNs produce large all or none EPSPs
that do not resemble complex spikes seen in mammals. Two modes of
spontaneous activity were observed in these neurons that could signify
different behavioural states of these neurons. Further, I will show
preliminary data on how these neurons behave during the optomotor response
and discuss the future work plan. <br> Understanding the Homeostatic Mechanisms of PI4P During G-Protein
Coupled Receptor Signalling </br><br>The transduction of external stimuli via G-protein coupled
receptor (GPCR) signalling pathways results in several important cellular
responses. In the visual transduction cascade of Drosophila melanogaster,
the light-sensitive GPCR (rhodopsin) triggers enzyme phospholipase C
(PLC), which hydrolyses the phosphoinositide lipid PI(4,5)P2 to generate
second messengers and propagate the signal. Maintaining PI(4,5)P2 levels
during signalling is important to sustain the response and any regulatory
mechanisms must be capable of keeping pace with the rapid turnover rates
of the lipid during signalling. The recycling of PI(4,5)P2 is a multi-step
pathway, involving many lipid intermediates and lipid-modifying enzymes,
distributed between two compartments - the plasma membrane (PM) and the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The mechanisms by which PI(4,5)P2 turnover is
coordinated between these two compartments have only been partially
elucidated.
The immediate precursor for PI(4,5)P2 synthesis is another
phosphoinositide - PI4P. Primarily localised to the Golgi apparatus, a
significant fraction of PI4P also resides in the PM. Recent studies in
mammalian cell lines have reported that maintaining the PM pools of PI4P
is important during GPCR signalling events. PI4KIII&#945;, an enzyme that
synthesises PI4P, has been shown to transiently localise to the PM in
complex with two other proteins. My project aims to understand the
mechanisms by which the synthesis and maintenance of PI4P occurs at the PM
in the context of GPCR signalling. I will present the results obtained
from preliminary experiments involving the downregulation of PI4KIII&#945;
and its putative interacting partners in Drosophila photoreceptors. <br> Characterization of I ? switch to different cellular organelles </br><br>A eukaryotic cell function is tied to regulated uptake and
secretion of different bio-molecules. This is orchestrated by various
functional fusion events between different intracellular compartments:
Plasma Membrane, Early and Late Endosomes, Golgi Network, Endoplasmic
Reticulum (ER), Lysosomes to name a few. These compartments are
functionally connected to each other via a series of controlled fusion
events between their membranes. One of the crucial determinants of this
functional networking is the acidity of the lumen of these compartments
which is maintained by proton concentration, concentrations of different
counter ions (Cl-, HCO3-, K+, Na+, Ca2+), membrane ion permeabilities and
various ATP-dependent proton pumps. Maintenance of intracellular pH
homeostasis is essential for protein glycosylation, protein sorting,
biogenesis of secretory granules and transport along both biosynthetic and
endocytic pathways.
Keeping in mind the physiological pH ranges, there is a need to devise and
characterize a repertoire of I-switches which can function at different pH
range and thus, can report on the pH dynamics of the concerned
organelle/pathway.
To tune the functional pH range of I-switch we have changed the sequence
of i-motif forming sequences by increasing the length of ?C? stretch from
three cytosines (I3) to seven cytosines (I7). With increasing number of
cytosines we see a shift in the functional pH regime of the I-switch
towards more basic pH. Cytosines get hemiprotonated (C+-H-C basepairing)
which drives the formation of I-motif. pKa of Cytosine N3 is ~4.45, thus,
conventional DNA4 I-motifs have maximum stability at pH 5.5. Thus it
should be possible to tune the pH response of I-switch towards a more
acidic or basic pH regime by changing the pKa of the constituent
cytosines. This could be done by introducing specific chemical
modifications to cytosine which changes pKa of cytosines to lower pKa
(5-bromo-cytosine, pKa~ 2.45) or higher pKa (5-methyl-cytosine, pKa~4.7)
respectively than cytosine, should drive the formation of i-motif to
either more acidic or basic pH. <br> Variation and Regulation of Individual Dance Activity in Honeybee
Foragers </br><br>The waggle dance behaviour, which is the only known
communication system in insects to incorporate both a motivational aspect
as well as navigational information pertaining to the food source, enables
a honeybee colony to efficiently exploit food sources in its vicinity.
Earlier work has shown that individual foragers differ in their dance
activity. I am interested in understanding how consistent these individual
differences are, as well as understanding how the social group influences
the activity of the individual foragers. I will present data which shed
new light on how the honeybee dance behaviour may be regulated. <br> Transcriptomic analysis identifies Rala as a regulator of flight
downstream of Store Operated Ca2+ Entry in Drosophila neurons. </br><br>Inositol (1,4,5) Trisphosphate (IP3) is a second messenger that
mediates the release of intracellular calcium via the IP3 Receptor (IP3R).
IP3R is known to play an important role in controlling a variety of
Ca2+-dependent cellular functions. Mutations in the only gene for the IP3R
in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster result in flight defects [1].
Similar flight deficits are observed by knocking down IP3R or STIM, the
calcium sensor on the ER, specifically in the nervous system indicating a
neuronal requirement of intracellular calcium signaling for flight. The
expression of IP3R and STIM is essential during initial stages of pupal
development for adult flight indicating a developmental role [2]. Although
it is now well established that IP3R and STIM function is required for
flight circuit development in pupae, the cellular or molecular events by
which the phenotype is manifested remain poorly understood. A likely
hypothesis is that dynamic changes in intracellular Ca2+ levels, either
through IP3R or store operated calcium entry (SOCE) or both, alter the
frequency of Ca2+ spikes and thus duration of global Ca2+ transients in
flight circuit neurons thus affecting gene transcription, as seen in
non-excitable mammalian cells [3]. In order to identify transcriptional
changes that succeed IP3R and SOCE mediated cytosolic calcium surges in
excitable cells using this system, I have measured the transcriptional
profile of the pupal central nervous systems of control and STIM knockdown
animals by next generation RNA sequencing to identify genes regulated by
SOCE.
One of the genes down-regulated upon SOCE knockdown was Rala, a small
GTPase which is the fly homolog of the mammalian RalA. I will present my
experiments to show Rala?s role in Drosophila flight downstream of SOCE.

satarae </br><br>Commensalism with humans has evolved in many animal species
ever since the early humans adopted a sedentary lifestyle. Through
commensalism, these species have adapted to a wide variety of food
resources, which were not originally part of their natural diet. The gut
microflora is a physiological variable influenced by the kind of diet as
well as host phylogeography. In this AWS, I will present preliminary
results of a comparative analysis of the gut microflora communities of two
rats Rattus rattus, a human commensal and Rattus satarae, a non-commensal. <br> Effects of Depression on Episodic Memory Updating </br><br>Rationale: When a consolidated episodic memory is
reactivated, itbecomes labile and modifiable and can also be updated or
integrated with new learning (Hupbach et al., 2007). Acute psychosocial
stress effects onepisodic memory updating have shown impairments in
updating (Dongaonkar et al., 2013). We decided to explore the effects of
severe or chronic stress on episodic memory updating. Prolonged periods of
stress culminates into depression. We therefore studied episodic memory
updating in depressed individuals.
Participants: Patient Group - Individuals between 18-50 yrs diagnosed with
Depressive Disorder or Bipolar Disorder and admitted to NIMHANS for
treatment.Control Group- Age and education matched individuals without a
history of brain injury or drug abuse or psychiatric treatment.
Methods: Participants learned a set of 20 objects (list 1) on day 1. On
day 3, half of the participants were reminded of list 1before learning a
second set of 20 different objects (list 2). Both patient groups and
control group were therefore split on Day 3 into a ?reminder? or ?no
reminder? condition. Memory for list 1 was tested on day 5 in all groups.
Results: Memory updating involves the incorporation of list2 items into
list 1 memory, contingent upon the reactivationof list 1 memory. We
replicated the updating in control reminder group.Updating was impaired in
the depression reminder group while updating was partially impaired in
bipolar reminder group.
Conclusion:Updating of memories is crucial for planning and predicting
future scenarios such as in problem solving and decision making.
Depression impairs the ability to update memories which may in turn affect
the way depressed individuals make decisions and solve problems <br> Structural Basis of Target Site Recognition by Hes1 Structure
Determination of Human Sirtuin 4 Protein </br><br>Hes1 protein belongs to basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
super-family of transcription factors and is an important downstream
effector of NOTCH signalling. Hes1 contains three functional domains- bHLH
domain, orange domain and C-terminal region. The bHLH domain of Hes1 binds
quasi-palindromic sequences called N- and E- boxes with high specificity.
The orange domain is predicted to enhance specificity and affinity of Hes1
towards target DNA. Hes1 regulates transcription primarily by binding to
N and E boxes located in the promoter regions of target genes. I aim to
unearth the structural basis of target site recognition by Hes1.
Sirtuin4 is mitochondrial enzyme. <#14d7a1eac682afca__msocom_1> It shows
mono ADP ribosyltransferase activity and Deacetylase activity. GDH
(Glutamate Dehydrogenase) is known target of Sirtuin4. Mono ADP
ribosylated GDH is no more enzymatically active. Sirtuin 4 regulates TCA
cycle, insulin secretion, ATP levels, fatty acid oxidation and cell cycle
arrest during double strand DNA damage. <#14d7a1eac682afca__msocom_2> The
structural mechanism utilized by Sirtuin 4 to ADP ribosylate target
proteins is not known. I aims to unearth the Structural Basis of sirtuin4
activity. <br> Cytoskeleton interacting adaptor proteins template membrane
organization of transmembrane proteins. </br><br>The eukaryotic cell surface is a bilayer made up of lipids and
proteins, and there is mounting evidence that suggests both active and
passive mechanisms function to organize components of the plasma membrane
(1). The underlying actin cytoskeleton dynamics appears to be a major
player in the mechanics of organization of components of the plasma
membrane. It is known that the components of plasma membrane interact with
the cytoskeleton directly or indirectly via adaptor molecules. The focus
of my work is to identify novel cytoskeleton interacting proteins which
function as a regulator of the membrane organization and probe their
functionality in the spatiotemporal organization of plasma membrane
components. For characterizing membrane cytoskeleton interaction we have
generated small molecule inducible chimeric protein system (FKBP-FRB
system: where FK506 binding protein (FKBP) interacts with FKBP rapamycin
binding domain (FRB) in presence of rapamycin). Our results suggest
different cytoskeleton interacting adaptor proteins attached to FRB having
actin binding domains help organize proteins on the membrane. We have also
explored functional implications of these interactions using in vivo model
system; DE-cadherin based cell-cell adhesion system. My results suggest
that the cytoskeleton interacting adaptor protein ?alpha catenin as well
as actomyosin machinery is required for the organization of DE-cadherin
protein on the membrane. These interactions are crucial for maintaining
the tissue integrity and remodelling of the junctions in Drosophila
embryo.

experiments with recombinantly expressed and purified full length prion
protein has revealed that Cu2+ ions bind to the disordered N terminal
octarepeat domain via three major binding modes2. These binding modes are
critically dependent on the protein to copper ratio, pH and have
affinities in the nanomolar to micromolar range.
 Interestingly, different strains of the prion aggregates purified from
the brains of diseased patients contain varying amounts of copper and
zinc and can be interconverted by carefully controlling the content of
these metal ions3, once purified. There is much debate regarding the role
of transition metal ions in prion diseases as to whether they delay or
accelerate the misfolding and as a consequence, the aggregation of the
normal cellular protein4.
 In this AWS, I will discuss mouse prion protein aggregation kinetics in
the presence of substoichiometric amounts of Cu2+ under physiological
conditions of 37 degrees and pH 6.5. Strikingly different aggregates are
formed depending upon the presence and absence of copper which have been
characterized by AFM. Furthermore, HX-MS experiments on these fibrils
have shown that the octarepeats are considerably more protected in the
Cu2+ containing fibrils.Given the basis of different prion strains lies
in the structural dissimilarities between prion protein aggregates5, we
hope to draw parallels between in-vivo results and in-vitro experiments
performed under carefully controlled conditions. While still preliminary,
the role of copper as a potential ligand tuning the aggregation pathway
of the prion protein will be discussed.

yeast </br><br>Eukaryotes are visibly distinguishable from prokaryotes by
their intracellular compartments. Since all extant eukaryotes share the
core set of compartments, compartmentalization preceded their Last
Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA, 1.8 billion years ago). Though the
origins of chloroplasts and mitochondria are well worked out, the same
cannot be said about compartments constituting the endomembrane
trafficking system like ER, golgi, lysosomes etc. For them, ?autogenous
theory? is proposed which states that new compartments arise progressively
by reorganization of pre-existing endomembrane system. The mechanism for
reorganization, as proposed by Dacks and Field [2007], states that every
compartment?s identity is encoded by a set of genes whose duplication and
diversification leads to formation of new compartments. Since compartment
identity is most crucial for vesicle trafficking, the obvious candidates
for ?identity-encoding? genes are Rabs, SNAREs, coats and tethering
factors.
Thus, ?autogenous theory? posits a biological scenario in which all the
?identity-encoding? gene families expand synchronously and an entire
complement of these ?identity-encoding? genes co-evolves amongst
themselves while diverging away from their old-interaction partners to
designate the new compartment. Since inter-species hybridization results
in bringing together species which have evolved independently for
considerable amount of time, it automatically results in doubling of all
genes with possible elimination of cross-talk across the parental
proteomes in the hybrid species.
S.pastorianus, the lager-beer brewing yeast is a hybrid of S.cerevisiae
and S.eubayanus formed around 500 years ago whereas the species themselves
diverged away from one another for 18 million years. I am comparing the
endomembrane system of the hybrid with that of its parents to test
autogenous theory. <br> Expression of Non-heme Iron Oxygenases ? From Prokaryotes to
Eukaryotes </br><br>Non-heme iron oxygenasesconstitute a well-studied class of
enzymes in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The oxygenase component,
together with a reductase and sometimes a ferredoxin, form a
multicomponentsystem. They carry out a variety of reactions, such as
dihydroxylation, monohydroxylation, desaturation, sulfoxidation,
dealkylation, and N-glycolylation in stereo and regio- specific manner.
The versatility of these enzymes makes them useful for large-scale
biosynthesis of chiral compounds. Although the structure and function of
different prokaryotic ROs have been extensively characterized, similar
studies of eukaryotic ROs have not been reported. The structural
information of these enzymes can help us to manipulate and modify these
enzymes to improve the efficiency as a biocatalyst. In this talk, I will
be presenting two different systems that belong to the same family of
non-heme containing ReiskeOxygenases. In the first part, I will focus on
two genes: DAF-36 from C. elegans (nematode worm), and Neverland (Nvd)
from D. melanogaster (fruit-fly). DAF-36 and Nvd play a major role in the
early stages of steroid hormone biosynthesis, primarily in the conversion
of cholesterol of dehydrocholesterol.It is noteworthy that the proposed
RO-catalyzed reaction is oxygen-dependent desaturation and
monohydroxylation, neither of which is well characterized even in
prokaryotes. In the second part, I will focus on the CMAH gene. This gene
is important in the conversion of N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) to
N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc). CMAH is absent in human and considered
one of the important genes that differentiate human from chimpanzee and
other mammals. The primarily goal of this project is to express these
recombinant proteins in soluble form and study their structures using
X-ray crystallography. In this presentation, I will cover the various
experimental conditions tried so far to express these recombinant protein. <br> Understanding the folding/unfolding mechanism of hyperthermophilic
protein Ctd-MK0293 </br><br>Small, single domain hyperthermophilic proteins have become
increasingly important as models for protein folding. We have investigated
the folding/unfolding kinetics of the hyperthermophilic protein Ctd-MK0293
(C-terminal domain of MK0293). The 83-residue C-terminal domain of MK0293
forms an alpha/beta ubiquitin-like fold. This protein is natively present
in the archaeal methanogen Methanopyrus Kandleri which survives in
temperatures upto 110?C. Kinetic analysis using stopped-flow circular
dichroism (CD) and fluorescence reveals apparent two-state kinetics;
however, nonlinear effects in the denaturant dependence of the unfolding
rate demonstrate changes in the position of the rate-limiting barrier
along the folding coordinate as the folding conditions change, rather than
movement of the transition state on a broad energy plateau. <br> resilience and reprogrammability in eukaryotic traffic systems </br><br>Eukaryotic cells are composed of membrane bound compartments,
each associated with a unique function. Molecules are shuttled across
compartments as and when required, and along specific paths, in packets
called vesicles. The specificity with which a source compartment produces
vesicles and these vesicles find correct target compartments is achieved
in the cell using intricate sequences of reactions regulated at various
levels. These reactions involve molecules present in the cytoplasm, on the
compartments and on the vesicles going between them. We have built a
Boolean model of the traffic system with which we test the idea that the
local information provided in the compositions of the compartments and
vesicles is sufficient to encode the topology of the system. We encode
traffic systems as Boolean networks; by controlling broad, statistical
properties of these networks, we are able to generate traffic systems of
various levels of complexity. Thus, by studying these properties we
elucidate molecular means by which the cell can modulate features of its
traffic system. The traffic system is constantly in communication with the
environment of the cell, and is prone to perturbations, which could be a
signal, a pathogen, or caused due to the function of some other system in
the cell itself. We find that the traffic systems generated by our model
are resilient to perturbations; that is, they spring back to their
original functional state once the agent causing the perturbation is
removed. Another interesting feature of these systems is their ability to
reprogram; that is, without changing the underlying molecular-interaction
network these systems can switch to a different compartment-connectivity
pattern in response to external circumstances. <br> Single brain mass spectrometry and neuromodulation of the honey
bee foraging trip </br><br>Honey bees are probably the only insects that can perform
repeated natural behavior under manipulable conditions. Although genetic
experiments are not available for honey bees as yet, it is still possible
to understand the neural basis of such complex behaviors at the level of
the whole brain. An individual honey bee's foraging trip involves a
sequence of changes in the motivational state of the bee, thereby causing
a change in behavior. It is known that substances called neuromodulators
are involved in the switch between different behaviors. I would like to
describe the motivational changes occurring during the foraging trip of
the honey bee using single brain mass spectrometry. This necessitates a
good accuracy and precision of the technique. I will show the results of a
few experiments showing how the technique has now been optimized for
neurotransmitters. I will show the changes in neurotransmitter levels
between starved and fed, and bees caught at night and just before foraging
starts in the day. <br> The role of 5-HT2A in cell matrix adhesion </br><br>The serotonin receptor subtype, 5-HT2A, is a G protein-coupled
receptor which is expressed in multiple areas which include the
gastrointestinal tract, platelets and the nervous system. It affects
multiple physiological processes, one of which is platelet aggregation. In
the present study, we probe a not so well-studied role of the 5-HT2A,
which is cell-matrix adhesion. Earlier work, in the lab, showed that the
rat 5-HT2A increases the adhesion of HEK293 cells to many cell
matrix-related substrates. It was also seen that PKC and CaMKII were
involved in this process. It was also observed that many 5-HT2A antagonist
affected cell-matrix adhesion and ketanserin and risperidone also affected
adhesion-related genes in the mouse hippocampus.
In other experiments it was observed that the rat and human 5-HT2A
activated different signalling pathways though they both played a role in
cell matrix adhesion. I am currently investigating the role of human
5-HT2A in cell matrix adhesion in greater detail. I have observed that
similar to the rat receptor 1nM 5-HT increases adhesion in HEK293 cells
stably expressing human 5-HT2A (AB1) and 10nM risperidone, an
antagonist/antipsychotic, decreases adhesion, even in the presence of
100nM 5-HT.
Serotonin-mediated adhesion of AB1 cells does not seem to be affected by
inhibition of PKC or CaMKinase II. Secondly, activation of both rat and
human 5-HT2A induces actin stress fibre formation which disappears with
5-HT2A antagonists. Thirdly, when AB1 cells were plated on poly-ornithine,
they exhibited high adhesion which was 5-HT2A independent. Earlier results
with the rat receptor also had shown that the 5-HT2A-mediated adhesion was
seen with laminin, fibronectin and gelatin but not with polyornithine.
 In addition, work to explore the adhesion process in cell lines from
tissues that express the receptor endogenously are in the process. To
this end I have begun experiments with fibroblasts and keratinocytes from
wild type and a recently generated 5-HT2A(-/-) i.e. knockout strain. <br> Understanding the role Cx35 containing gap junctions in neural
circuit development </br><br>Increase in gap junctional connectivity followed by its
decrease has been observed in many organisms both vertebrates and
invertebrates. This phase of transient electrical coupling correlates with
the onset of chemical synaptogenesis. It has also been found that gap
junctions could potentially disrupt the formation of a known chemical
synapse in an invertebrate model system (leech) where gap junction forming
subunits are different from vertebrates. Gap junctions in vertebrates are
formed by connexin subunits. There are 40 connexin genes known in
zebrafish so far. I am particularly interested in Connexin 35 (Cx35) which
is a fish orthologue of mammalian Cx36. Cx36 is known to be specifically
present in the central nervous system and Cx36 knock out mice lacks 95% of
gap junctional connectivity in their brain. My interest lies in
understanding roles of Cx35 forming gap junctions in the development of
neural circuits. We have observed that Cx35 is expressed in the larvae as
early as 3hpf. Extensive immunoreactivity for Cx35 is present in many
brain regions of zebrafish larvae such as Habenulae, olfactory bulb, optic
tectum, reticulospinal neurons, and cerebellum. Our data also supports
Cx35 expression in a subpopulation of Rohon-Beard neurons only at 2dpf
(days post fertilization).
In my AWS I will show the expression of Cx35 in various brain regions of
zebrafish larvae. I will talk about dye coupling which is a measure of
functional electrical synapses. We observe dye coupled neurons in the
region where extensive Cx35 immunoreactivity is present. I shall discuss
the effect of Cx35 downregulation in zebrafish by using splice block
morpholino antisense oligonucleotide and its effect on neural circuit
development. Also electrophysiological recordings from Purkinje neurons
suggest a potential role of Cx35 mediated gap junctions in forming
excitatory presynaptic connections. <br> Effects of stress on astrocytes and its implications on neuronal
plasticity </br><br>Stress is an adaptive measure taken by the body in order to cope
with an adverse stimulus called stressor. However, these adaptive measures
come at price. Brain is the central organ which not only orchestrates the
stress response but also gets adversely affected by it. This, with time,
precipitates to multiple forms of stress disorders. Most of the stress
literature has understood these effects in a neuron centric view. It is
only recently that the glial cells have been considered as an important
piece of the puzzle. My project broadly aims at understanding how stress
affects astroglia and their role in sculping some of the key features of
stress disorders. The hippocampus and the amygdala are two structures in
brain which show contrasting stress induced phenotype that has been mostly
investigated in a neutron centric perspective. I am specifically
investigating some of the morphological and functional aspects of these
cells in the two brain regions, and finding out if the key to the contrast
lies in the role played by the astrocytes in stress. <br> Phase segregation of passive molecules in an active fluid:
Implication for molecular segregation at the cell surface </br><br>Several studies (1,2) have shown that GPI-anchored proteins
(GPI-APs) and transmembrane proteins with actin binding domains (TM-ABDs)
are distributed on the cell surface in distinct dynamic nanoclusters
driven by actomyosin flows in the cell-cortex. The nanoclusters of the
individual molecular species appear to be segregated at larger scales ?
this larger scale segregation too is likely to be driven by cortical
actomyosin. Using the framework of active hydrodynamics to describe the
dynamics of the cell-cortex and its coupling to the components of the cell
membrane , it was shown (1) that the dynamic nanoclustering of molecules
such as GPI-AP was a result of being driven by short actin filaments under
myosin motor activity, via the formation of dynamic 'asters'. This work
suggested a classification of cell surface molecules based on their
interaction with cortical actin : passive molecules - which bind to
actomyosin filaments and inert molecules - which do not. Based on this
picture, I will introduce a theoretical framework, using Monte-Carlo
simulations, to understand the mechanism of multiscale segregation of
passive molecules from inert molecules, driven by active actomyosin. The
theory makes many qualitative predictions, including the existence of a
novel active phase segregated state, even at temperatures higher than the
equilibrium critical segregation temperature ? a situation relevant to the
cell membrane, where equilibrium lipid phase segregation has only been
observed at temperatures much lower than physiological temperatures (2).
This active phase segregated state exhibits properties very distinct from
the conventional equilibrium segregated state. In particular, it shows
strong fluctuation dominated phase ordering akin to some driven
nonequilibrium statistical mechanics models, such as passive slider model,
and intermittency as in turbulence. I will also discuss how this
theoretical framework could be extended to address features of large scale
actomyosin-based segregation in living cells, observed using
fluorescence-based experiments.

tumorigenic, self renewing, invasive and migratory. CD66 itself has been
shown to promote migration, invasion and metastasis in many cancers
including pancreatic, colon and gastrointestinal cancers. A functional
role for CD66 in cervical cancers has not been analyzed so far. The goal
of this project is to examine the role of CD66 protein in the migratory
subset in cervical cancer and to determine its molecular interactions. One
mechanism through which CD66 could impinge on migration is by
regulation/activation of the Src kinase pathway - I am examining this in
greater detail. I also plan to take an unbiased approach to identify novel
interactors of CD66 in cervical cancers. CD66 is a member of the CEACAM
family, with an immunoglobulin domain, known to have both homotypic and
herterotypic adhesion role. Work from our lab has found an enrichment of
this molecule at metastatic sites. I hypothesize that homotypic
interactions of CD66 on tumour cells and on the surface of distant sites
of metastasis may allow for initial cell adhesion 'docking' or tumor
cells. I will discuss this idea and the approach I plan to take to address
this hypothesis. <br> Coupling between outer leaflet proteins and actin cytoskeleton
drives nanoclustering of lipid anchored proteins </br><br>GPI anchored proteins (GPI-APs) constitute a significant
percentage (0.5%) of eukaryotic membrane proteins. The GPI anchor helps
these proteins to attach to the membrane and associate with specific
cholesterol and sphingolipid enriched microdomains. These microdomains
serve as platforms for the organizing cytoplasmic signaling molecules and
the membrane environment for a variety of signaling proteins. Work from
our laboratory has shown that the underlying actin cytoskeleton helps in
the organization of GPI-APs and long-acyl chain containing lipids into
nanoclusters and that Phosphatidylserine (PS) is the inner leaflet linker
which connects GPI-APs via acyl chain interactions to the actin
cytoskeleton ((Goswami et al., 2008; Gowrishankar et al., 2012))
(Raghupathy et al., 2015). This interaction crucially depends on the
chemistry of both the outer leaflet and inner leaflet molecules. In my
talk I will discuss ongoing experiments to explore adaptor proteins that
link PS to actin. This is currently the missing link in our understanding
of the mechanism of formation of nanoclusters and the different cues that
would facilitate the formation of ordered membrane domains at the cell
surface.

doi:10.1016/j.cell.2015.03.048 <br> Neuropeptides and the IP3 receptor </br><br>Neuropeptides are a class of signaling molecules that are
released either systemically or locally, and can regulate behavior and
physiology, based on environmental or developmental cues. They are
specifically made in neuroendocrine cells, packaged into dense core
vesicles and released in a calcium dependent manner. Since the IP3
receptor is a modulator of intracellular calcium signaling, the broad aim
of the projects is to understand if and how the IP3 receptor regulates
neuropeptides. Using Drosophila as a model system, and focusing on
neuropeptide-producing cells that are marked by the dim transcription
factor, I will describe two projects that I have been working on:
1) What neuropeptides require a functional IP3 receptor in order for an
organism to survive nutritional stress? Drosophila has three larval molts,
culminating in a pupa and finally adult. We subject larva in the third and
last larval stage (L3) to nutritional stress and ask if the organism is
able complete it's developmental cycle. Typically, control flies in early
L3 can survive starvation, by pupating and emerging as fully formed,
albeit small, adults. By knocking down the IP3 receptor in various
neuropeptide producing cells, I tested which neuropeptides are required
for survival in this assay. To complement this screen, a Mass Spectrometry
based peptidomics study too has been attempted. I will summarize the hit
that I got with genetic screen, and progress made on the mass spectrometry
experiments.
2) Role of IP3 receptor in modulating TOR and Insulin signalling pathways:
Metabolic phenotypes displayed by an IP3 receptor mutant, itpr-ku, can be
rescued by over-expression of wild type IP3 receptor in
neuropeptide-producing cells. Building on this, I observe that
over-expression of positive regulators of insulin and TOR signalling
pathway in neuropeptide-producing cells can rescue the nutritional
sensitivity displayed by itpr-ku . These suggest that the IP3 receptor can
be a modulator of protein synthesis. I will present preliminary evidence
for this hypothesis. <br> Regulation of phototransduction and PI(4,5)P2 turnover in
Drosophila photoreceptors by septins. </br><br>The septin family of proteins was first discovered in the
budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and later found to be present in
fungi and in many animal phyla. The name septin refers to the involvement
of these proteins in cytokinesis and septum formation. Septins contain a
nucleotide-binding sequence homologous to the consensus sequences of the
GTPase superfamily. Drosophila genome encodes five septin genes. Several
studies on septins show its role in cytokinesis. However the function of
these proteins in mature neurons is not clear.
In our model system Drosophila photoreceptors, we have found experimental
evidence supporting the existence of distinct pools of lipid molecules
(PIP2). However the mechanism by which those pools are kept separate from
mixing up is not clear. The existing published literatures on the role of
septins as a diffusion barrier make these proteins an interesting
candidate molecule.
To study the role of septins in phototransduction, we started with RNAi
screening against Drosophila septins. In the screen we found that knock
down of one of the septins, pnut shows an increase in light sensitivity as
evident from electroretinogram recordings, indicating that pnut controls
light response in adult photoreceptors. We also found that knocking down
pnut cause increased PIP2 turnover rate in photoreceptor cells. These
results collectively suggest for its potential role in lipid turnover. <br> Understanding the role of Cortical Actomyosin in plasma membrane
organization of the Cell adhesion receptor CD44 </br><br>The Lymphocyte homing receptor CD44 is a dually palmitoylated
transmembrane adhesion receptor that binds the polymer hyaluronic acid in
the extracellular matrix 1. The protein is known to interact with the
actin cytoskeleton indirectly via cytoskeletal adaptors such as Ezrin and
Ankyrin. CD44 is also capable of being reversibly palmitoylated. While
Palmitoylation is crucial for its endocytosis2, its ability to bind actin
is required to control the migration of T cells in interstitial spaces3.
CD44 is known to exist in a clustered distribution at the cell surface,
potentiated by Galectins binding to its extracellular domain4.Here we
explore the role of protein palmitoylation and actin binding in
organization of the protein on the cell surface.
We first study the plasma membrane organization of the CD44 receptor in
its native, un-stimulated condition. We explore how the different
attributes of the protein, namely, palmitoylation and its ability to bind
actin via Ezrin or Ankyrin influence its cell surface organization, and
affect its signaling outcome. Using Homo FRET based measurements 5 to
probe for the nano-scale organization of this molecule, our studies on the
native CD44 and various actin binding/ palmitoylation defective mutants
have revealed a hierarchically structured organization under resting
conditions. We find that the ectodomain (responsible for Galectin
binding), and actin-binding are separately involved in clustering this
molecule at the nano scale. Perturbations of cholesterol levels and
actomyosin dynamics also disrupt the organization of the protein. This
implicates a key role for an active actomyosin network in clustering this
protein in its native state. We are now exploring the consequences of the
changes in organization on its functional consequences.

regulation of drosophila flight </br><br>Calcium is synonymous with a wide variety of cellular processes
such as gene transcription, signal transduction, neural excitability etc.,
which could all potentially impact animal behaviour. Two key molecules of
interest in Ca2+ signaling are the endoplasmic reticulum resident Ca2+
channel, namely, inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) and the ER
calcium store depletion sensor, namely, stromal-interacting molecule
(STIM). A number ofextracellular stimuli that activate GPCRs can lead to
the rapid release of Ca2+ from the ER stores, via the IP3R. Subsequently,
store depletion is sensed by STIM, which then oligomerize and appose
against the ER-PM junctions to facilitate ORAI channel formation. It is
through these channels that Ca2+ from the extracellular milieu enters the
cytoplasm, a process known as store-operated calcium entry, SOCE. In
Drosophila, mutants of IP3R show wing posture and flight defects. These
phenotypes are recapitulated upon pan neuronal down regulation of IP3R or
STIM, demonstrating a neuronal requirement of these genes for this
phenotype. More specifically, work is the lab has shown that SOCE in
dopaminergic neurons is required for proper flight circuit function and
development.
My project aims to identify subsets of dopaminergic neurons that require
SOCE in the context of flight and to establish the identity of GPCRs on
them. Towards this end, I have chosen to work on the FMRF receptor (FR),
previously identified in the lab. I shall present some preliminary data to
show that perturbation of FR levels or components of SOCE in certain
subsets of dopaminergic neurons can affect flight in Drosophila. <br> What limits tree establishment in the grasslands of montane
tree-grass mosaics? </br><br>The forest-grasslands mosaics, where forests and grasslands
co-occur within a same landscape with abrupt transitions between them, are
unique bi-phasic ecosystems across the globe. In the high altitude of
India?s Western Ghats, one such bi-phasic ecosystem of tropical forests
(locally called shola forests) surrounded by grassland has been in
existence for more than 20000 years. These forest patchesand
grasslandsshare abrupt boundary between them. It has been previously
argued that these systems are structured by microclimates and soils, but
these hypotheses have never been explicitly tested and the factors which
limit native trees from colonizing grasslands remain unclear. At the same
time, an exotic species, Acacia mearnsii has been found to proliferate in
grasslands. In this context, I tried to address the question: What
maintains this landscape mosaic where native tree species are unable to
establish in adjoining grasslands but an exotic Acacia species is able to
do so? In this AWS, I will present results of my field experiments which
examine the effects of microclimates and soils on the seed germination and
seedling survival of native shola tree species and exoticAcacia in
grasslands. I will also discuss the important role of cold winter
conditions for maintaining shola-grassland mosaics and how global climate
change poses a significant threat to maintaining this unique high-altitude
ecosystem. <br> Airflow mediated antennal positioning in flying hawkmoths </br><br>During flight, most insects hold their antennae at fixed
positions relative to their head. This position depends on information
from multiple sensory modalities like vision, airflow, etc. How does the
underlying nervous system combine information from such disparate sensory
modalities to determine the antennal position? To address this question,
we computationally modeled the known antennal circuitry including the
multisensory antennal circuit. The antennal circuit may be modeled as two
loops -- one which maintains the antenna at a particular position, and
another one which computes where the antenna is positioned. It also
predicts that both these neuronal loops run continuously and independently
such that eliminating one would not affect the other. We performed
experiments to test the predictions of this model. From previous
experiments, we know that both moths and bees bring their antennae forward
(decrease the angle between antennae) when subjected to increasing
airflow. This active change of antennal position with changing airflow
shows that airflow is one of the sensory cues that the antennal circuitry
uses to compute antennal position. We further showed that it is the
mechanosensory Johnston's organ situated at the base of the antenna, which
senses airflow and sends information to the underlying antennal circuitry.
We also found that sensory inputs from Johnston's organ from both antennae
were necessary for proper antennal response to airflow, indicating that
bilateral information is necessary to compute the position of one antenna.
As a follow-up to this, we are currently perturbing the antennae at
different airflows to test if the antennal neural circuitry has two loops
as the model predicts. According to our model, antennal perturbation will
affect just the first loop that maintains antennal position, and airflow
information affects just the second loop that computes where the antenna
should be positioned. By investigating antennal perturbations at different
airflows, we can test if two such independent loops actually exist and the
output is as predicted by the model. <br> Biochemical and cellular mechanisms of inherited cardiomyopathy </br><br>The most frequent cause of primary cardiomyopathies are
mutations in the genes encoding sarcomeric proteins. We are focusing our
studies on tropomyosin (Tm) (TPM1 locus) and troponin T (TnT) (TNNT2
locus) mutations. Tm is a central component of the regulation of muscle
contraction which interacts with actin, troponin complex and myosin. TnT,
which is seen as a complex with troponin I and C, interacts with
tropomyosin at the N terminal. I have chosen HCM (hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy) and DCM (dilated cardiomyopathy) mutants based on their
clinical severities and locations within the Tm and TnT proteins. I have
checked multiple biochemical parameters for the same. I have also designed
TALENs to mutagenize TPM1 in embryonic stem cells as well as in humanized
mouse models. Our goal is to determine the biochemical and cellular
characteristics of these mutant proteins so as to provide a basis for
small-molecule treatment of the cardiomyopathies. <br> MicroRNA, miR-124 is essential for cephalic ganglion patterning

,Dasaradhi Palakodeti* </br><br>Planarians are bilaterally symmetrical fresh water animals
capable of regenerating the whole body or lost tissues and organs. They
have specialized cells called neoblasts, which are functionally equivalent
toembryonic stem cells. MicroRNAs are small RNA species that control gene
expression by modulating translation and mRNA stability. MicroRNAs have
been implicated in the regulation of various cellular processes such as
neurogenesis, cell cycle, stem cell function and etc. Recently, we
identified several miRNAs whoseexpression is enriched in different
neoblast subpopulations and inthe regenerating tissues at different time
points during planarian regeneration. Ourresults also revealed miRNAs,
such as sme-mir-2d-3p and sme-mir-124families, whose expression is
enriched in the cephalic ganglia, and in brain primodia during CNS
regeneration. We were also able toknockdown sme-miR-124c-3p using LNA
anti-miRsto study its function incephalic ganglion regeneration in
planarians. Knockdown of sme-miR-124cshowed varied photoreceptor

Further analysis of phenotype revealed disorganized optic chaisma and
disrupted neuronal connections betweencephalic ganglia and ventral nerve
cord.Transcriptome analysis of miR-124c knockdown animals showed increased
levels of genesinvolved inaxon guidance cues. Thus these results suggest
that miR-124cis a key regulator of axon guidance cues essential for proper
patterning of neurons in planaria. <br> How can we resolve the active membrane composite </br><br>The outer membrane of the living cell is the interface that
demarcates the cell and its environment. Its chemistry is largely build up
from lipids and proteins. Local organization of this chemistry primes the
cell to adapt and react to the external milieu and communicate information
about its internal state. In a range of metazoan cells the membrane
organization is not passively assembled but actively maintained away from
thermodynamic equilibrium. Non-equilibrium organization and dynamics
emerges from the interplay between the constituents of the membrane with
an active composite juxtaposed the plasma membrane. Cells consume energy
to mechanically restructure this composite that consists out of, amongst
others, the evolutionary conserved proteins such as actin, actin binding
proteins and myosins. Previously published studies and studies in progress
from the lab are identifying biochemical components and pathways that
regulate the actin composite and its interaction with the membrane. My
particular interest goes to the actual spatial structure of the actin that
is regulating local membrane chemistry. I will discuss the route which we
are undertaking to resolve this. <br> Characterization and reversal of synaptic changes triggered by
acute stress in the amygdala </br><br>A single overwhelming traumatic event can lead to the
development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) over time. Clinical
studies have demonstrated that PTSD patients show hyperactivity in the
amygdala, a brain structure involved in processing neuroendocrine stress
response and emotional memories. Most animal models of PTSD have examined
the immediate effects of repeated stress and hence failed to capture the
delayed development of this disorder. An earlier study in the lab had
shown that 2-hour episode of acute stress causes increase in anxiety and
spinogenesis in the principal neurons of the amygdala not one, but 10 days
after stress. Examining the synaptic correlates of these findings, we
found that acute stress led to an increase in basal excitatory
transmission in the amygdala.
Next, we wanted to probe signaling mechanisms underlying the effects
described above. One of the potential targets was the endocannabinoid
(eCB) system, which is involved in modulation and gating presynaptic
neurotransmitter release. We find that systemically blocking FAAH (enzyme
involved in hydrolyzing eCB) during stress, hence increasing eCB levels,
reverses delayed increase in basal excitatory transmission. Further,
blocking FAAH activity also prevents stress-induced delayed spinogenesis
in the amygdala. We also show how blockade of the endocannabinoid receptor
(CB1) interacts with changes in the endogenous pool of eCBs available at
the synapse and how this interaction is influenced by stress. These
findings are consistent with accumulating clinical evidence, which
indicate a crucial role for the endocannabinoid (eCB) system in protection
against PTSD and suggest pharmacological modulation of eCB system as a
possible therapeutic target. <br> Reorganizing the host cell: Exploring the changes in hepatocyte
architecture during malarial infection </br><br>Malaria is caused by the protozoan parasite belonging to the
Plasmodium spp. The parasite has a complex life cycle involving distinct
stages in different hosts. The disease is transmitted to humans by the
bite of a female Anopheles mosquito, which injects a form of the parasite
called sporozoites. These sporozoites home into the liver where they
infect hepatocytes. Within an infected hepatocyte, a single sporozoite
develops into tens of thousands of merozoites in a few days, achieving one
of the fastest growth rates for a eukaryotic cell.
 Previous studies have shown that as the parasite grows, the infected
hepatocyte undergoes significant changes such as increase in cell size.
However, these variations have not been systematically addressed. We are
investigating these changes to hepatocytes in the context of the liver
tissue. Specifically, we aim to understand whether the inherent polarity
of the hepatocyte has a role in Plasmodium development and sustenance.
Towards this, we use the rodent malarial parasite- Plasmodium berghei, as
a model to recapitulate the liver stage infection. We are currently
establishing high-resolution imaging techniques and 3D image analysis
tools on Plasmodium infected liver sections. Preliminary results indicate
instances where the parasites appear to make close contacts with the
apical surface of the hepatocyte plasma membrane. In future, we plan to
use super-resolution microscopy and electron microscopy to zoom into
these potential contact sites and simultaneously develop tools to assess
their functional significance. <br> structure and function studies of nucleotide sugar transporters </br><br>Glycosylation, the covalent attachment of the sugar moieties
to proteins and lipids plays important roles in various biological
processes, such as organ development, viral and bacterial
infections/immune response, and cancer invasion1. Nucleotide sugar
transporters (NSTs), are eukaryotic membrane proteins of the SLC35 family
that transport the nucleotide sugars from the cytosol to the ER and the
Golgi apparatus thus forming the link between sugar transport and
glycosylation. They function as antiporters, transporting nucleotide
sugars into the ER or Golgi and nucleoside mono-phosphates out of the ER
or Golgi.2,3
Although there has been progress in identifying NSTs and defining their
substrate specificity, there is a dearth of structural information on this
class of transporters. Structural biology methods are essential to address
questions concerning the transport mechanism of the nucleotide sugars, and
molecular basis of substrate specificity.
Crystallization of membrane proteins present a formidable challenge. To
tackle this, we are using a high throughput GFP based screening and
purification technique4 to rapidly screen expression and biophysical
properties.. We have successfully cloned 18 NSTs from various organisms
and have expressed 8 and purified 1 of these to apparent homogeneity.

Sachharomyces cerevisiae <br> Collective behavior in mound building termites </br><br>The biological world abounds in examples of collective and
coordinated behaviors across scales ranging from single cells to
organismal groups. These include bacterial cultures, swarms of bees,
flocks of birds, herds of buffaloes, etc. A central aspect of such
collective and coordinated behaviors is their ability to maintain order
despite external perturbations, even though mutual interactions between
animals may be highly non-linear. To address this question, we are
investigating an interesting behavior that we observed in termites of the
species Odontotermes obesus, which self-organize and move in a constant
circular patterns when introduced in a circular area. Although the initial
orientation of such termites may be quite random, they rapidly reorganize
and mill around the arena at constant rates for several minutes. How do
these termites transition from randomness to order? What sensory cues are
involved in this process? These are some of the questions that we hope to
address in the coming years using this assay. In my talk, I will describe
some preliminary observations about this behavior. <br> The effect of monsoon season droughts on dry forest seedlings </br><br>Dry forests are highly threatened ecosystems which are
highly seasonal in nature. They face multiple threats including
increasingly long dry spells within the monsoon period which are likely to
negatively effect seedling survival. Seedlings usually emerge during the
monsoon months and generally do not face prolonged drought stress until
around 1 month of age. This study aimed to investigate survival of 9
common dry forest species and to look at what functional traits are
predictive of survival time. Two groups of dry forest seedlings were
subjected to a continuous drought starting at 7 days and 21 days of age.
We found that seedlings survived for longer when the drought started at 7
days than when it started at 21 days and this is related to the number of
leaves on the plant when the drought starts. The main avenue of water loss
in a plant is through transpiration which occurs through the leaves. This
finding suggests that the 21 day plants are dying faster since they are
losing more water through their leaves. Other functional traits, such as
SLA and seed size which in other studies have been shown to be predictive
of growth and performance of plants, appear to be poor predictors of
survival at this young age. <br> Phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-Kinase (PIP4K): Role in
membrane trafficking in Drosophila melanogaster </br><br>Phosphatidylinositol 5-phospahte 4-Kinase (PIP4K)
phosphorylates Phosphatidylinositol 5-phospahte(PI5P) to
Phosphatidylinositol 4,5- bisphospahte (PI(4,5)P2) in a cell. The lipid
PI5P is present in extremely miniscule levels in vivo and cannot majorly
contribute to several hundred fold higher levels of PI(4,5)P2 at the
plasma membrane. This questions biochemical relevance of this Kinase.
 CG17471 encodes the only PIP4K in Drosophila melanogaster (dPIP4K).
Cellular fractionation revealed the presence of dPIP4K on the plasma
membrane and several endomembrane compartments including endosomes and
lysosomes (Gupta et. al, 2013). A priori, various phosphoinositides
Kinases and phosphatases have been implicated essential to the
maintenance and trafficking of different endomembrane compartments. I have
used the developing Drosophila photoreceptors as a model system to
understand the cellular role for dPIP4K.
The photoreceptors neurons have their apical plasma membrane specialized
into a microvillar structure called the rhabdomere, that houses majority
of proteins directly involved in phototransduction. The formation and
maintenance of the rhabdomere involves active membrane turnover cycles,
any failure in which leads to a collapse this structure and improper
retinal development. Through my experiments I could demonstrate a role of
dPIP4K in developing photoreceptors. A knockout of dPIP4K called the
dPIP4K29 showed massive clusters of endosomes and lysosomes with increased
turnover rates of the major opsin ?Rh1. I will present recent findings
providing pointing to dPIP4K being a novel regulator of Clathrin dependent
endocytosis in Drosophila. <br> The RNA targets of FUBP1 </br><br>The set of transcribed genes is different in different cell
types. Since an RNA Binding Protein binds specific target sequence(s)
,which is defined by its structure, it could potentially be binding to
very different sets of RNA molecules in different cell types. Moreover it
could potentially have varied effects on its targets depending upon
whether the specific binding sequence is situated on the untranslated
region(UTR) or the coding region of the mRNA. Therefore the same RBP could
be performing very different roles in different cell types depending upon
the transcriptome of the respective cell type.
 FUBP1 is known to bind ssDNA as well as RNA. Although its role in binding
 Far Upstream Sequence Element(FUSE) of Myc there by regulating its
expression has been well studied, its RNA binding property in specific
contexts remains to be known. We hope to find answers to such questions
as: what are its RNA targets in embryonic stem cells? where is the
specific binding sequence located on its targets, UTR or coding region?
what would happen in FUBP1 knock-out cells? What happens to the levels of
proteins that are coded by its target mRNAs, do they increase or
decrease? does the increase/decrease have anything to do with where the
consensus sequence is situated on the mRNA? We plan to address the same
questions in the context of neurons and glia, because transcriptome data
from stages of neuronal differentiation reveals that though the
expression of Myc goes down steeply as differentiation furthers, the
FUBP1 transcription remains high making neuronal cells very suitable to
study purely RNA binding role of the protein. <br> Structural mechanism utilized by the NS3-NS5 complex of Japanese
Encephalitis Virus to replicate the viral genome. </br><br>Japanese encephalitis virus(JEV) is a neurotropic virus and
is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in the world. JEV belongs to
genus Flavivirusand the genome is composed of a single stranded positive
sense RNA molecule.The genome of JEV is about 11kb long with a
5?cap(m7G5?ppp5?A) and no polyA tail at 3? end. The virally-encoded NS3
and NS5 proteins are centrally involved in the replication of viral
genome. TheNS3 houses a protease activity in the N- terminal region and a
RNA helicase activity in the C-terminal part.NS5 possesses a
methyltransferase activity and aRNA-dependent-RNA Polymerase activity in
the N- and C-terminal regions, respectively. The NS3 and NS5 proteins
associate to form a complex that may represent the minimal replisome and
serves to generate multiple copies of the progeny genome. Using
structural, biochemical and biophysical tools I aim to discern how the
multiple enzyme activitiesin the minimal replisome are coordinated to
synthesize copies of the viral genome. The progress made towards this end
will be presented. <br> Comparison of sequence search methods for remote homology detection </br><br>Proteins are composed of structural and functional units
called domains. A protein maybe composed of one or more domains. Most
eukaryotic and many bacterial and archeal proteins are multi-domain in
nature. The domain combinationscan undergo insertions/deletions,
rearrangements and shuffling giving rise to different domain combinations
increasing the functional repertoire.
There are many sequences in the non-redundant (NR) sequence database for
whom no structural information is yet available; hence, it becomes
necessary to identify the sequence homologues for the structural entries
and domains.
Genomic Distribution of structural Superfamilies (GenDiS) comprises of
sequence homologues (searched in NR) for Structural members at protein
domain superfamily level. Further, it classifies sequence homologues for a
given superfamily according to their taxonomic hierarchy and also provides
information about their complete domain architecture.
In order to identify remote homologues for the structural entries,
conventional sequence search methods were implemented in an improved
strategy to enhance their sensitivity, as a continuation of interests in
our laboratory. In my AWS, I will be talking about sequence search methods
to identify remote homologues and profile-based methods to validate their
specificity. <br> Regulation of Cdc42 mediated CLIC/GEEC endocytosis </br><br>Endocytosis is a process through which cells internalize
cargoes such as nutrients, growth factors, fluid, etc. Multiple pathways
of endocytosis ply at the plasma membrane. Although the classical
endocytosis pathway involves Clathrin (a coat protein) and Dynamin (a
protein requited for vesicle scission), numerous functional roles are
emerging forendocyticpathways independent of these proteins. Our lab is
interested in one such pathway, called the CLIC/GEEC pathway (CG Pathway;
Clathrin-independent carriers/ GPI-AP enriched early endosomal
compartment), which is necessary for uptake of GPI Anchored Proteins
(GPI-APs) along with the majority of fluid. CG endocytosis is regulated by
small GTPases, Arf1 and Cdc42, and is sensitive to both plasma membrane
composition and dynamic actin. Further, real time analysis has shown
recruitment of Cdc42 to the site of endosome formation right before
pinching of the vesicle.
This pathway is also involved rapid turn-over of plasma membrane and is
reported to be polarized towards the leading edge of migratory cells.
Therefore, it is imperative to explore the mechanism of regulation of
Cdc42 in the context of CG endocytosis as Cdc42 also plays a significant
role in cell polarity and migration. I will be discussing my work plan
towards the same. <br> Neural organization of antennal mechanosensors in insects </br><br>Insect flight involves fast and intricate maneuvers that
requires precise sensory feedback. Specifically, for stabilization of
flight, insects depend on rapid mechanosensory feedback from the antennae,
along with somewhat slower feedback from their eyes. It has been
speculated that the variation in antennal morphologies across insect taxa
reflects its diverse mechanosensory functions. Yet, despite varying sizes
and antennal morphologies, the basic sensorimotor apparatus of the antenna
is highly conserved across insects. The mechanosensory apparatus at the
base of the antennae includes the B?hm?s bristles and Johnston?s organs,
which provide primary feedback about antennal movements. Whereas the
Johnston?s organs detect small amplitude, high-frequency vibrations of the
antennae during flight (Sane et al., 2007), the gross positioning of the
antenna is mediated by mechanosensory inputs from the B?hm?s bristles
through a putative monosynaptic pathway (Krishnan et al, 2012). Although
B?hm?s bristles-like structures are present in most insects including
honey bees, crickets, and cockroaches etc. which occupy diverse ecological
niches, it is not clear if the underlying neural circuitry in insects is
conserved. In a comparative study, we show that the neural projections of
B?hm?s bristles across three phylogenetically distant insect orders ?
Lepidoptera (moths), Hymenoptera (honey bees), and Orthoptera (crickets)
are similar despite morphological and functional differences in the
antennal forms and functions in these three insects. <br> Understanding Activity-dependent selective transport of mRNAs in
Dendrites : A computational Approach. </br><br>Localisation of mRNA serves the general purpose of maintaining
asymmetric distribution of proteins in the cytoplasm. In neurons, mRNA
localization is an important mechanism for local protein synthesis at the
synapses, which is known to influence synaptic plasticity and hence
learning and memory. Dendritic mRNA transport is specific and rapid and
can be regulated by neuronal activity. Several studies have reported that
activated synapses recruit mRNAs for local translation.
It is well established in literature that mRNAs get transported in large
complexes called mRNPs( ribonucleoprotein) along microtubules engaging the
motor proteins Kinesin and Dynein. We are interested in understanding how
selective transport is regulated by the activation of pathways regulating
microtubule dynamics and motor proteins. We adopt a computational approach
to address this. In my AWS, I will be presenting the work done so far in
this regard. <br> Spatio-temporal aspects of activity in cultured neurons </br><br>We measured electrical activity in cultures of hippocampal
neurons using high density microelectrode arrays. These devices allow for
a spatial localization of current sources within about 40 ?m on an area of
2.5 x 2.5 mm and are therefore capable to distinguish the activity of
different neurons.
The aim of this study is to relate the activity found at different
locations with the surrounding network activity. That allows to estimate
the variability between single units and observe how their activity level
is homeostatically maintained over time.
We find that the spatial patterns during bursts of activity are
repetitive, but individual neurons participate in those bursts rather
irregularly. <br> The neuro-biological influence of early life enrichment on the
effects of later life stress. </br><br>The amygdala and hippocampus exhibit strikingly different
patterns of plasticity in response to both positive and negative
experiences. For example, aversive experiences like chronic stress
strengthen amygdala-dependent cued fear memory and its cellular correlates
in the basolateral amygdala, while impairing hippocampal plasticity and
spatial memory. Paradoxically, positive experiences like environmental
enrichment reduce cued fear memory and amygdalar LTP, while hippocampal
plasticity and spatial memory are enhanced. This raises some intriguing
questions, such as - can the contrasting plasticity patterns of enriched
environment and stress counterbalance each other? Does an enriched brain
develop resilience to stress?
 As a behavioural readout of hippocampal and amygdalar function, we
tested for contextual fear memory formation using a paradigm that
severely restricts the amount of time given to the hippocampus to
encode its spatial context. In this paradigm, the amygdala
processes the aversive stimulus (foot shock), while the hippocampus
encodes the spatial context in which the animal receives the shock. While
control and chronically stressed rats both showed low freezing responses
indicating poor contextual memory, enriched animals showed a robust
expression of the same memory. Interestingly, stressed rats that were
raised in an enriched environment showed an even stronger recall of fear
memory. We then used the expression of an immediate early gene, c-Fos, as
an activity marker to look at patterns of
neuronal activity during the formation and recall of contextual fear
memory. We found that while the density of FOS positive cells during
recall of contextual fear memory was greater in the lateral amygdala of
both groups of enriched rats, stressed animals also showed
elevated numbers of FOS positive cells. This pattern does not
reflect our behavioural results. However, on analysing the CA1
region of the hippocampus, we found that the density of FOS positive cells
during recall of contextual fear memory in the enriched and
enrichment followed by stress groups was significantly higher than
controls, whereas that in the stress group was not different from
control levels. We next studied long-term potentiation (LTP) in
vitro in the lateral amygdala using the whole-cell patch clamping
technique. We found that while stress enhances LTP in the amygdala and
enrichment impairs LTP, cells that were enriched followed by
stress also showed and impairment of LTP in the lateral amygdala.
These results suggest that enrichment may confer a degree of
resilience to the effects of stress. <br> The Chemistry andEvolution ofWing Color Patternsin Papilio

(non-mimetic & ancestral), romulus (mimetic) and stichius (mimetic). The
two mimetic forms, romulus and stichius mimic two toxic
buttefliesPachliopta hector, and P.aristolochiae respectively(Kunte,
2009). Recent studies have shown that these forms are controlled by
different alleles of a single gene doublesex (Dsx)rather than by a
supergene (tightly linked cluster of many genes).(Kunte et al.,
2014)(Nishikawa et al., 2015)One of the phenotypic outcomes of mimicry is
an alteration in the wing color pattern. The mimicry hypothesis postulates
that in acquiring mimetic phenotype a species pays a cost in terms of
sexual selection(Kunte, 2009). Presence of fluorescence in wings is
regarded as a sexual signal in butterflies. It has been observed that when
a mimetic form appears, fluorescent signal is lost, which is present in
the non-mimetic ancestral form (Kunte, unpublished). This is seen
throughout Papilio. This fluorescent signal is localized in the white
patches present in the non-mimetic form. The pigment involved in this
fluorescent signal is unknown and the mechanism governing this change is
also not understood.Hence, understanding this can be an important link
between ecology of mimicry and its genetic basis.
I propose to understand the chemical and genetic bases of pigmentation in
Papilio swallowtail butterflies. I will perform chemical analysis of
pigments and genomic analysis of pigmentation pathway genes in various
female forms of Papilio polytes and the toxic species that they mimic. <br> Genetic and Developmental Bases of Wing patterns in Papiliobutterflies </br><br><p>Papilio swallowtail butterflies are models for ecological and evolutionary studies due to the diversity of mimicry that they exhibit. Several Papilio (e.g., P. polytes, P. dardanus, and P. glaucus) exhibit female-limited mimicry. The popular notion for several years was that a ?supergene? (tightly linked group of genes) was responsible for regulation of wing patterning, such that different wing morphologies develop in mimetic and non-mimetic females. Recently, a single gene, dsx was shown to regulate wing patterning in P. polytes butterflies, by means of differentially expressed alternately spliced isoforms. More recently, it was shown that the dsx gene has undergone an inversion, possibly after the divergence of P. polytes from its relative P. xuthus, which may be responsible for very low recombination in this region. Suppression of dsx expression in the mimetic female forms by RNAi has also shown to revert the phenotype to non-mimetic-like form, indicating that dsx in turn regulates pigment and patterning genes that are involved in mimetic phenotype. Using P. polytes as the model system, I would like to identify the different players involved in formation of the mimetic phenotype by transcriptomic studies and a genome-wide association study. I would also like to characterize the dsx allele in the three female forms of Papilio polytes by sampling across their geographical range.</p> <br> Modeling and characterisation of biological memories across scales </br><br><p>Components of biological memory have mutiscale components i.e. they operate at diverse time- and spatial-scales e.g. electrical activity in neuron operates at milliseconds timescale with mostly localised computation whereas bistable chemical network in synapse operates at hours to days timescalewith more &quot;diffused&quot; computations. It has been shown that a linear increase in memory capacity with number of synapses can be achieved by exploiting the multiscale variables in synapse. Moreover, memory decay follows a power law (inverse square root of time) [Benna and Fusi].</p>

<p>Using Bena and Fusi&#39;s theoretical model as computational principle behind biological memories, I propose to implement a network using electrical models of neurons and chemical signalling pathways to understand the time dynamics of memories. For immediate future work, we plan to study the dynamics of synaptic efficacy over time, its sensitivity to neuron morphology and distribution of spines (smooth and spiney), effect of channel distribution and excitability homeostasis on plasticity. Some generic chemical models of synapse and electrical model of neuron have been implemented in MOOSE. We have been adding more details to them: more detailed published chemical model of synapse, multi-compartment model of neuron using real morphological data and a known distribution of channels and spines. The utility library of the MOOSE simulator is being extended for easy integration of multiscale models in MOOSE simulator.</p>
 <br> Stress dependent evolution in bacteria through manipulation of
tRNA levels </br><br>Bacteria adapt to stress in various ways. Recent work
indicates that one such means is the generation of novel translational
products not encoded in conventional reading frames. I propose to test the
hypothesis that tRNAs could mediate a stress response by generating
proteome diversity through (i) mis-initiation and (ii) misacylation.
Bacterial cells show changes in the levels of charged tRNAs under stresses
like amino acid starvation and hypoxia. Strains depleted of initiator
tRNAs will be tested for mis- initiation under different stress regimes. 
I hypothesize based on previous results that strains depleted of initiator
tRNA will show translation initiation at alternate sites along mRNAs and
at non-AUG codons, potentially using amino acids other than methionine.
Misacylation and misincorporation frequency will also be examined in wild
type E.coli and in strains depleted of initiator tRNA under both short and
long term stresses. While in the short term, an altered proteome may help
tide over a stress, prolonged maintenance of the stress could lead to the
evolution of new traits via genetic changes that consistently produce the
novel beneficial peptide(s). Alternatively, under weak or inconsistent
stress, diverse phenotypes may arise but not be genetically fixed
(~canalized). While canalization of a new phenotype may occur with rarely
encountered and long term stresses, retaining the ability to explore many
phenotypes (without canalization) could serve as an adaptation to survival
in changing environments. In this, my first annual work presentation, I
will discuss preliminary data from the mis-initiation part of my work. <br> Folding during Unfolding </br><br>It is generally considered that only native contacts are
formed during transition from unfolded (U) to native (N) state. But many
interactions other than those present in the native state can be generated
during the folding reaction. The PI3K SH3 domain is an 82-residue protein
whose structure is composed of five &#946;-strands and two helix-like
turns. It was thought to be a two state folder, but recent studies have
shown the presence of equilibrium as well as kinetic intermediates1.
Kinetic unfolding studies has revealed the presence of intermediate, IU,
which has N like secondary structure and U like Tyr fluorescence, which
gives it a molten globule like character 1. This intermediate has been
shown to have a transient non-native burial of W53, the sole Trp in the
protein2, which is present in the exposed surface of the protein in native
state. Here, we have studied kinetic unfolding of SH3 domain of PI3K in
sub millisecond time domain and tried to find out more complexity in the
folding reaction of the protein; using the sole W53 and ANS fluorescence
as probes. There is a reverse dependence of unfolding rate with the GdnHCl
concentration, which gives a clear indication that it is a folding like
event happening during unfolding of the protein.

flow which they require to stabilize. Because the eyes of an insect cannot
move relative to its head, gaze stabilization in insects is achieved by a
reflexive head movement counter to the aerial turn. Studies on this
phenomenon in flies have revealed that the head movement is controlled by
sensory inputs from both the eyes, and the mechanosensoryhalteres which
inform the nervous system about the angular momentum of the body during
aerial manoeuvres. In non-Dipteran insects which do not possess halteres,
it is not clear whether the head stabilization process requires
mechanosensory input, or if it can be achieved through purely visual
processing of the optic flow. This problem is especially pertinent to
moths and other nocturnal insects, because purely visual control of head
stabilization would be substantially slower than mechanosensor-mediated
mechanisms. In my seminar, I will describe head stabilization in Oleander
hawk moth, Daphnis nerii, which serve as an ideal system to address these
questions. Preliminary results of our studies indicate that both vision
and mechanosensory input from antenna mediate head stabilization in moths. <br> Structure ???Function Studies on Eukaryotic Nucleotide Sugar
Transporters </br><br>Glycosylation, the attachment of the sugar moieties to
proteins, lipids and proteoglycans plays important roles in various
biological processes, such as organ development, viral and bacterial
infections/immune response, and cancer invasion 1 . Nucleotide Sugar
Transporters (NSTs) of the SLC35 family (Solute linked carrier) are
essential multi-spanning membrane proteins located in the Golgi or ER that
transport the nucleotide sugars from the cytoplasm to the Golgi where they
get covalently linked to
proteins/lipids by glycosyltransferases. The transport of these sugars is
coupled to the antiport of the corresponding nucleoside monophoshphate
(NMP) 2 . The crucial role of the NSTs have been highlighted by a variety
of transporter mutants that lead to severe congenital diseases in humans,
to decreased virulence of parasites and yeast pathogens (*Leishmania, and
Candida*) and developmental defects in eukaryotic model organisms
including *C. elegans* and *Drosophila* 3 . Although there has been great
progress in identifying NSTs and defining their substrate specificity,
there is a dearth of structural information on this class of NSTs to
address questions concerning the transport mechanism of the nucleotide
sugars, and molecular basis of substrate specificity. Furthermore, the
necessity of these transporters in pathogenic microbes makes them
attractive pharmacological target for rational drug design.
The main objective of the study is to have an understanding on how this
class of transporters works at a molecular level. We plan to take a
structural approach and elucidate the three dimensional structure of
nucleotide sugar transporters by x???ray crystallography and use various
biochemical and biophysical techniques to gain insights into the basic
mechanism of substrate recognition and transport dynamics of the NSTs.
This is to understand how they work and as well as for the development of
agonists/antagonists towards this class of proteins.
Towards this, we have identified and have clones of 26 members of the
SLC35 family from various eukaryotic genomes from the Abramson lab and Dr.
Luis M. Bredeston (University of Buenos Aires).We have carried out
expression tests and detergent screening of several NSTs with reasonable
expression of
some of them (NSTs from *C.elegans*, *Xenopus* and few others) in yeast.
We have also optimized large scale purification of some of the targets and
obtained initial crystals of a *C.elegans* NST diffracting to 7?
. We are
currently optimizing these crystals for better diffraction and structure
solution.

tuberculosis infection </br><br>In eukaryotic cells, Endocytosis is the pathway for
internalization of materials like nutrient etc. from the extracellular
milieu. The pathway is compartmentalized into early, recycling, late and
lysosomal routes. Rab proteins, small GTPases, with their effector
interactome such as EEA1 (Rab5 effector) provide distinct identity to each
compartment. Rab5 and Rab7 are involved in the early and late stages of
the endocytic pathway respectively, while Rab11 plays crucial role in
recycling of cargo back to plasma membrane. Rabs also play important role
in the phagocytic pathway.Most of the intracellular pathogens manipulate
host cell trafficking by targeting Rabs and their effectors. One of these
dangerous and infectious intracellular pathogens is Mycobacterium
tuberculosis(Mtb)- causativeagentof Tuberculosis (TB) disease. Mtbinvades
macrophage cells through phagocytosis and modulates the pathwaysuch a way
thatMtb containing phagosomes don?t fuse with lysosomes as they are
destined to. Being in a vacuole (i.e. phagosome), Mtb interacts
significantly with the host trafficking pathways and modulates them to
fulfill needs such as nutrient acquisition. While it is well known that
Mycobacteriumblocks phagosome maturation, the effect of the mycobacterial
infection on the endocytic pathway and its interactions with the
components of the endocytic machinery are underexplored. In this study, we
aim to explore the effects of Mtbinfectionon the host endocytic
machinery.Towards this, we have optimized quantitative image methods for
analyzing endosomal populations in single cell resolution. We
immunostained Mtb infected THP1 cells for EEA1 (early endosomes) and Rab11
proteins (Recycling endosomes) and compared the endosomal populations
betweennon-infected and infected THP1 cells using quantitative image
analysis. Our results show that number of EEA1 endosomes (early endosomes)
and also total intensity of EEA1per cell significantly increase in
infected cells. Total Rab11 intensity also significantly increase in
infected cells but number of recycling endosomes don?t change. These
observations suggest that Mtb infection alters host endocytic pathway and
can have differential effects on distinct endosomal populations. In
future, we aim to validate these findings and initiate experiments to
understand their mechanistic basis. <br> The role of olfaction in flour beetle resource preference </br><br>Tribolium castaneum is one of the most successful cereal
flour pests known that shows a worldwide distribution. One of the key
factors contributing to its success is its ability to find and colonise
heterogeneously distributed cereal flour reserves in a large landscape. It
has been noted previously that Tribolium castaneum has an expanded odorant
receptor (OR) gene family when compared to other insects. However, only a
very few studies have attempted to establish the behavioural implications
of this expanded OR family, and subsequently, its consequences on the
fitness and cosmopolitan distribution of this species.
In my AWS, I will present my current work-plan and the results of some
pilot experiments. I attempt to establish whether olfaction is sufficient
for the red flour beetle to successfully locate and distinguish between
different food resources. After standardizing a few behavioural setups, I
plan to explore what resource adult beetles prefer and whether this
preference varies across several natural populations present in India. I
use simple behavioural choice assays and plan to analyse them in
conjunction with whole-genome-sequence data to determine the genomic and
transcriptomic variation of these ORs across populations. Data from my
behavioural experiments so far indicate that olfaction alone is sufficient
for adult flour beetles to distinguish between different resources. <br> Design and development ofan efficient catalytic nucleophile-
based biomaterial to prevent organophosphates- mediated deactivation of
Acetylcholine Esterase (AChE) </br><br>Acetylcholine esterase (AChE) is a crucial enzyme required for
recycling of neurotransmitter acetylcholine at neuronal synapse.
Inhibition of AChE results into accumulation of Acetylcholine in synapse
and hence continuous stimulation of postsynaptic receptors resulting into
neuronal dysfunction or death. This mechanism is therefore used by many
classes of pesticides like Organophosphates and Carbamates to target AChE
of insects and other pests. However, due to non-specificity, these
pesticides are equally toxic to humans when they are exposed.
Due to lack of using preventive measures, agriculture workers get exposed
to alarmingly high concentration of pesticides during farming practices
that lead to a wide range of health disorders like abdominal pain, blurred
vision,weakness, seizures, coma and in some cases death. Majorly this
exposure happens via dermal and inhalation route. We aim to develop novel
nucleophilic-catalysts based biomaterials that can hydrolyse (deactivate)
pesticides before they enter into the body, thus prevent the potential
deactivation of AChE. Oximes, owing to their nucleophilicity are highly
potent catalysts that can be used to cleave Organophosphate (OP)
pesticides into non-harmful compounds. We are focused on synthesizing
polymeric form of these catalytic molecules and formulating them into
topical hydrogel, electro-spun fibers basedskin patches and facemasks to
prevent dermal and inhalation exposure to OPs.
I will discuss about synthesis and characterization of oxime-based
catalysts, and a series of kinetic experiments to evaluate their ability
to hydrolyze methylparathion, a widely used pesticide. <br> Crispr mediated genome editing approach to understand clinically
important microrna182 in malignant hematopoietic cells </br><br>In the last decade, chemo therapeutic resistance causing
relapse in chronic myeloid leukemia patients has been a daunting task for
scientists to understand. The promise of miRNA therapy is perhaps greatest
in cancer due to the apparent role of miRNAs as tumor suppressors and
oncogenes.I have earlier shown that miR182 is a critical regulator of CML
cells proliferation, and aids in I matinib resistance, implication of
which should be used to improve CML therapeutics. We find a novel,
intrinsic Bcr - Abl independent Imatinib resistance phenomenon mediated by
miR -182 over- expression. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short
Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) is exploited here to make the MIR-182 knock -
outs. We have identified various CRISPR sites adjacent to MIR- 182 locus
using Zhang Lab tool. Double strand breaks made by CAS9, and guideRNAs are
detected by surveyor nuclease assay, and MIR- 182 deletion is detected by
PCR method. We have successfully created an efficient CRISPR system to
make MIR182 knock -out. I`ll be presenting this work in detail <br> Are isolated populations of tigers genetically compromised? </br><br>Tigers are globally endangered, but populations are recovering.
Previous studies from our lab have revealed population structure within
tigers in the Indian subcontinent, highlighting an isolated population in
western India, the semi-arid population at Ranathambore, Rajasthan. These
tigers have been isolated from other populations for several generations
primarily due to historical anthropogenic effects. Theory suggests that
such isolation and small numbers should lead to low variation and possible
inbreeding.
We contrast results on heterozygisity and relatedness from micro
satellites and Genomic data. I will present data from simulations and
contrast them with empirical and suggest certain implications. One of
themost reliable ways to rescue such small populations is by increasing
the genetic connectivity. However, this could result in outbreeding
depression. We use genomic data to present preliminary analyses for local
adaptation in semi-arid tigers. Our long term goal is optimise the genetic
connectivity needed to genetically rescue the semi-arid population of
tigers, and present a possible approach. <br> Understanding the biochemical and biophysical changes due to
cardiomyopathy-causing sarcomeric mutations in human cardiac Troponin-I </br><br>Inherited mutations in sarcomeric proteins comprise a
significant proportion of primary cardiomyopathies. These result in a
gamut of symptoms ranging from arrhythmia to heart failure and even sudden
cardiac deaths. Two strikingly different forms of the disease are
identified - hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy
(DCM). There are certain prevalent hypotheses regarding the biophysical
and biochemical changes brought about by the mutations that can result in
these two contrasting phenotypes. However, of the various sarcomeric
proteins implicated, mutations in only some proteins (e.g. myosin) have
been extensively studied and characterized and shown to follow the
predicted trends. The aim of my study is to test whether these governing
principles hold even across thin filament proteins, particularly troponin
I and how are these changes in the biophysical and biochemical parameters
brought about by the mutants. <br> Control of Insulin receptor sensitivity by phosphatidylinositol
5 phosphate 4 kinase(PIP4K) during Drosophila larval growth* </br><br>During /Drosophila/ development, larval growth occurs
primarily through an increase in cell size. This process is regulated by
nutrition, endocrine control through insulin signaling as well as the mTOR
pathway. We have previously shown that the /Drosophila/ ortholog of
phosphatidylinositol 5 phosphate 4 kinase (dPIP4K) regulates cell growth
during larval development through its ability to positively regulate TORC1
output. However, the developmental input that regulates TORC1 activity via
dPIP4K remains unclear. We now show that in /Drosophila/ larvae, dPIP4K
activity is not required to transduce amino acid levels into cell growth.
Rather, dPIP4K is required for sugar homeostasis during larval
development. dPIP4K mutant larvae show suppression of developmental delay
and insulin resistance phenotypes when grown on a high sugar diet. Finally
we find that feedback control from TORC1 output regulates plasma membrane
insulin receptor sensitivity during /Drosophila/ larval growth. Thus
dPIP4K is as a key regulator of insulin sensitivity during nutritional
signaling. <br> Dynamics of SUMO upon interaction with SIM (SUMO Interaction Motif). </br><br>Dynamics of bio molecules can be crucial for its function.
Post-translational modifications like SUMO (Small Ubiquitin like
Modifiers) modification can alter the interaction and function of its
target proteins. One mode of interaction between a SUMO-modified protein
and its co-factor is through the non-covalent interactions between SUMO
and SBMs/SIMs (SUMO Binding/Interacting Motifs). SBM/SIMS is
characterized as hxhh or hhxh (h=val/Ile/leu and x=any amino acid)
sequence flanked by acidic amino acids, and in some cases serine residues.
In an interesting fashion, SBM/SIM interaction has been shown to induce
rigidity in SUMO. My present work attempts to understand whether altered
dynamics is a necessary cause of the induce rigidity. I will be presenting
the experimental results of NMR relaxation experiments and its
implications in the dynamics of SUMO proteins upon binding with SIM
peptides. <br> The Effect of Mutational Biases and Environmental Selection on
the Evolution of Bacterial GC content </br><br>The GC content in bacterial genomes varies widely across
species: from ~13% to 75% GC. Understanding how this variation arose and
why it is maintained is important for understanding other phenomena such
as the evolution of codon usage bias and protein-coding sequences, as well
as horizontal gene transfer. Classically, there have been two sets of
hypotheses to address the question of how variation in GC content arises.
The neutralist hypotheses suggest that variation in GC content arises due
to inherent mutational biases in different species. On the other hand,
selectionist hypotheses argue that environmental selection shapes and
maintains the GC content of the genome, and the variation in GC content
across species is a result of the difference in the nature of
environmental selection faced by these species. However, mutational biases
across species are not thought to be extremely variable across species. It
is now also known that the strength of selection as well as mutation rates
are not uniform across the genome. Moreover, mutation rates and biases may
themselves be under selection. Thus, mutational biases or environmental
selection alone may not be sufficient to explain variation in GC content
across species, and an integrated view of both kinds of processes is
necessary. A change in genome GC content may occur gradually in a scenario
where a mutant with an altered mutational bias arises in a population,
drifts or hitchhikes to a moderate frequency, then faces positive
environmental selection, and is maintained in the population for long
periods of time. Experimental evidence is required to determine the
relative contribution of neutral processes and
selective forces to the spectrum of mutations that fix in the genome.
One strategy to answer this question is to study the spectrum of mutations
that fix in mutants with altered mutational biases, which lack certain DNA
repair activities. I will discuss my work where I have generated such
mutants of *Escherichia coli *and show preliminary data which suggests
that in environments which are thought to impose selection on genome GC
content, these mutants vary in fitness. I will also discuss experimental
strategies to address the above question, where I plan to experimentally
evolve mutants with mutation spectra biased in the direction of GC-->AT or
AT-->GC, under relaxed selection and strong environmental selection. <br> Gene Regulatory Program governing mesoderm development in
Vertebrates </br><br>At the earliest developmental stage, a mouse embryo consists of
2 broad tissue domain. One, the embryonic domain giving rise to the embryo
proper, while the other being the extraembryonic domain giving rise to the
placenta and chorion. The embryonic domain consists of 2 tissue layers,
the inner epiblast and the outer hypoblast. At E:6.5 cells at the
posterior tip of the epiblast undergoes EMT and starts migrating in
between the pre-existing epiblast and hypoblast. This event is called
gastrulation.Thus gastrulation gives rise to a third tissue layer called
mesendoderm which is the precursor for both mesodermal and endodermal
tissues. A lot of signaling molecules like Wnt, Fgf, Nodal as well as
distinct transcription factors like Brahyury, Tbx6, Eomes, Mesp1 are
expressed in this migrating cell population. Tbx6 acts as a critical
mesoderm determining factor in this cell population. Not only mutational
analysis shows that loss of Tbx6 affects posterior mesoderm development,
but it is also shown that Tbx6 dependent inhibition of Sox2, a neural
marker, induces suppression of neural and promote mesoderm formation. Thus
Tbx6 is a critical cell fate determining factor in vertebrate mesoderm
development. But the expression of Tbx6 in mesendodermal cell
populationposes an important question. How does it regulate mesodermal vs
endodermal fate in this cell population? Does it have syntenic role in
mesoderm and endoderm development? Moreover mutational analysis of a lot
of other factors like Wnt3A, Brachyury also show similar abnormal mesoderm
developmental phenotypes as Tbx6 mutants. How does Tbx6 function along
with these factors? Does it have redundant role in vertebrate mesoderm
development?
The objective is to understand the role of Tbx6 in vertebrate mesoderm
development?
The specific aim is to identify the downstream binding targets of Tbx6 in
mesodermal tissue differentiated from Human Embryonic Stem Cells.
Preliminary results show that 36 hours of differentiation, induces maximum
Tbx6 expression in the differentiated cells. Thus 36 hours of
differentiated hES cells is determined as the time point for the chip
assay. Standardizations for the ChIP experiment are still in process. <br> Cognition and brain connectivity </br><br>Human beings display a great range of variability in
cognitiveabilities. Psychological tests capture this phenomenon, but the
underlying neural basis is not understood. The advent of MRI and other
non-invasive diagnostic techniques has allowed exploring of structural and
functional domains of the brain, addressing cognitive abilities at
different levels.
fMRI measures brain activity by detecting blood flow changes over time.
Similarity in fMRI signals of two brain regions over time indicates a
functional connectivity(FC) between them. Functional brain networks (or
intrinsic connectivity networks, ICN)have been identified using fMRI based
on such inter-regional connectivity.
These networks are known to show considerable variability in their
strengths of connectivity across individuals. A few studies have examined
the relationship between ICN connectivity and individual cognitive
abilities, and found correlations.However,these have been restricted to
single tasks and often single networks. To understand the neural bases of
cognitive abilities across multiple domains, we test healthyindividuals on
an extensive battery of 18 cognitive tests, and examine the relationship
between functional connectivity network parameters and performance across
multiple cognitive domains in our study. <br> The role of ecological selection on morphological diversification
and mating systems. </br><br>Polymorphism is a ubiquitous feature in biology and is central
to understand biodiversity, genetic variation and adaptations. One of the
most common forms of polymorphism is sexual dimorphism, a phenotypic
differentiation between males and females of the same species. One of the
predominant hypotheses driving sexual dimorphism is sexual selection.
However, this is not the exclusive selective pressure driving sexual
dimorphism. For example the females of the butterfly,Papilio polytes have
diverged from the ancestral and male like form, due to natural selection,
by mimicking other toxic butterfly species togain protection from
predators. Only the females of this species are polymorphic and occur in
three forms. The two mimetic forms, romulus and stichius, resemble toxic
models Pachliopta hector and Pachliopta aristolochiae whereas the third
form, cyrus, is non-mimetic and male-like. The persistence of the
non-mimetic form in spite of the clear advantage of reduced predation
pressure on the mimetic forms is an evolutionary riddle. Three sexual
selection hypotheses for the persistence of this non-mimetic female form
are: (1) male mate preference, (2) pseudo-sexualselection, and (3) sexual
harassment avoidance, along with two natural selection hypotheses: (4)
physiological trade-offs, and (5) frequency-dependant selection. I am
empirically testing theses hypotheses and evaluating their assumptions to
better understand the principles underlying the maintenance of
female-limited polymorphic mimicry.
Sexual selection is also known to be a major factor shaping mating
systems. Sexual selection has two components (1) Inter-sexual selection:
one sex chooses individuals of the other sex to mate and (2) Intra-sexual
selection: individuals of the same sex compete to gain access to mates.
Both these processes lead to differential mating success and
monopolization of matings by a few individuals. Nyctibatrachus petraeus,
an endemic torrent frog,with a low skew in reproductive success, is an
interesting exception to this phenomenon. Almost every male mates at least
once during the breeding season, most mate multiple times, and females lay
multiple egg-clutches. I am trying to understand the factors leading to
such relatively less skewed mating success, and its consequences for
reproductive biology, sexual selection and mating behaviour of this
species. <br> To Investigate Notch Function in Drosophila Blood Cells </br><br><p>It has been shown in Drosophilablood system that Notch signaling is important for fate specification and maintenance of particular type of blood cell known as Crystal cell. Loss and gain of Notch signaling in mature population of blood cells lead to an overall decrease or increase in lymph gland size and crystal cell number respectively. While importance of notch signaling in crystal cell specification and development has been well established, functional role of Notch in crystal cells and in other blood cell type has not been explored. Interestingly, our preliminary work highlights that loss of Notch function in the mature blood cell compartment is accompanied with systemicaccumulation of lipids in the whole animal. But in contrast Circulatory Blood cells show some morphological defects with less lipid deposition in them. So we hypothesize that Circulatory Blood cellswith active notch signaling is important for lipid uptake and lipid metabolism, which in turn necessary for their active functionality and plays key role in maintaining the lipid homeostasis in theanimal systemically.The goal of this work is to decipher the metabolic control regulated by Notch signaling in blood cells.</p> <br> Characterization of auts2 gene family in zebrafish </br><br>The autism susceptibility candidate 2 (AUTS2) gene is
associated with multiple neurological diseases in human. AUTS2 is a highly
conserved protein, primarily expressed in brain. Recently, it was shown
that AUTS2 protein plays a role in transcriptional activation of neuronal
genes and it also promotes neuronal migration and neuritogenesis in the
developing brain. The AUTS2 gene product shares a high level of similarity
with fibrosin (FBRS) and fibrosin-like 1 (FBRSL1) proteins, a functionally
uncharacterised polypeptides. We have cloned and characterized all members
of auts2 gene family in zebrafish. To dissect the functional role of auts2
during development and in adult, we induced inherited mutations in auts2
gene by using transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN)
system. We are also generating a tissue-specific knock-outs of all members
of auts2 gene family using CRISPR/Cas9 system. <br> Positive and negative interactions drive mimetic butterfly
community assembly in the Western Ghats, India </br><br>Species co-occurrence in ecological communities is influenced
by multipleecological and evolutionary processes. Phenotypic similarities
and differences of co-occurring species can be used to make inferences on
the role of ecological processes driving those patterns.Recent studies
incorporating phylogenetics intocommunity ecology suggested that
competition drives divergence in phenotype and in habitat preference
allowing species to co-occur.However, effects of other interspecific
interactions, such as mutualism and parasitism, are less explored.
Mimicry, an adaptation to gain protection from predators, exhibits both
M?llerian mimicry (mutualistic interaction) and Batesian mimicry
(parasitic interaction). Mimetic communities called mimicry ringsare
formed when multiple sympatric models and mimics gain protection from a
specific aposematic pattern. In this study, we examined role of
mutualistic and parasitic intersections along with common ancestry on
butterfly mimicry rings in the tropical forests of the Western Ghats,
India. A total of 25 out of 335 butterfly species participated in mimicry
rings in the Western Ghats. We found that M?llerian co-models were
phylogenetically clustered and have had similar phenotypes due to common
ancestry. On the other hand, Batesian mimics in the same mimicry ring
arrived at the mimetic wing patterns due to convergent evolution and
random phylogenetic assembly.
Apart from the ecological processes, species diversity within community
could be shaped by biogeographic process such as dispersal, colonisation,
in-situ speciation and extinction. The Western Ghats act as a habitat
island for many butterflies, so we compared the mimetic species
composition and diversity with another island and mainland to test some
predictions from island biogeography. Western Ghats consisted of fewer
number of mimicry rings, and on average fewer models and mimics per
mimicry ring, as compared to Malay Peninsula and Eastern Himalayan
Regions, which are habitat mainlands. The Western Ghats were similar to
oceanic island Hong-Kong in the diversity of mimetic community. Moreover,
within mimicry rings that were shared between the Western Ghats and
Eastern Himalaya, the Western Ghats rings were depauperate in species
richness, especially in the number of mimics. This may perhaps be due to
recent origins of the Western Ghats butterfly mimicry rings and a short
time span for which the mimicry rings have evolved, reflecting the long
isolation and trickling colonization into the Western Ghats. These results
highlight influence of evolutionary history and island biogeography on the
evolutionary assembly and diversity of mimetic butterfly communities. <br> Understanding multi motor cooperativity </br><br>Motor proteins use ATP and move directionally along filamentous
tracks driving the transport of a plethora of cargoes inside the cell.
Besides cellular transport they are also important in cell motility,
muscle contraction, cell division and other functions. They are broadly of
two types a) microtubule based motors (kinesins and dyenins) b) actin
based motors (myosins). Studies using single molecule assays has revealed
important biophysical properties of these proteins like their velocity,
run length and processivity, force produced by a single motor, stall force
etc. However, much cannot be inferred about the biological relevance of
the functional processes involving these motors from these kinds of
experiments because often the molecular motors work as ?ensembles? as part
of a larger complex inside the cell. In vivo studies using phagosomes and
other cargoes are now starting to reveal that Cooperativity among motors
and of different types underlines the basic principles dictating their
biological function.
Despite efforts to examine multiple motor behaviors, it has proved
difficult to characterize the sensitivity of most cargo transport
parameters attributing to motor copy number, and overall the precise
impact of motor number on intracellular transport processes remains
unclear; simply because different motors may differ in their inherent
biophysical properties and thus show different parameters, and also
experimentally it is difficult to characterize the precise number of motor
binding to the cargo being used in such studies. We try to understand this
cooperative behavior of motor function by studying two different classes
of kinesin motors with the help of ?DNA origami? as a tool. DNA origami is
the folding of a long single stranded DNA into discrete nanostructures.
The DNA origami structure can be then used as a scaffold to attach
multiple proteins with precise numerical as well as spatial control which
would possibly ?mimic? a cargo having different numbers of motor attached
to it. We intend to study the motility behavior of such motor-origami
complexes to gain insights into the mechanism by which cooperativity in
multiple motors influence their motion in biological cargo transport. <br> Genetic program regulatingvertebrate cranial mesoderm specification </br><br>Mesoderm is a source of an impressive array of tissues such as
muscle, bone, heart, blood, etc. This germ layer contributes to bulk of
vertebrate body plan. Along anterior-posterior axis, mesoderm can
beclassified as cranial and trunk mesoderm. These mesoderm subtypes and
their muscle derivatives show striking differences. Unlike trunk mesoderm
that gives rise to segmented epithelial structures called somites, cranial
mesoderm is unsegmented. Secondly, trunk musculature functions in
locomotion whereas cranial musculature is involved in eye movement,
mastication and facial expression. Intriguingly, signaling cues and
genetic program governing muscle differentiation are different for cranial
and trunk mesoderm. On the basis of these differences, we hypothesize that
developmental program of cranial mesoderm is fundamentally divergent from
that of the trunk mesoderm. While the key signals and transcription
factors regulating trunk mesoderm is well understood, very little is known
about cranial mesoderm development. To probe the divergence, at first, we
are elucidating gene regulatory program driving cranial mesoderm
development. Using mouse genetics approaches such as loss of function
mutant analysis as well as genetic lineage tracing, we show that unlike in
trunk, cranial mesoderm development is independent of key mesoderm factors
T and Tbx6. Our study points to redundancy in the cranial mesoderm
developmental program. Currently we are addressing the role of candidate
redundant genes Mesp1 and Twist1. We would also investigate possible
genetic interactions of these factors with T / Tbx6. In future, to test
the evolutionary origin of cranial mesoderm subtype, we will perform
comparative expression analyses of genes critical for its development in
evolutionary developmental models. <br> Study of wing hinge in honeybee </br><br>The evolution of flight has allowed insects to inhabit a
wide range of ecological niches. The typical size of an insect is small,
on the order of a few centimeters. At these sizes, insects must flap their
wings at frequencies that often exceed 100 Hz and may be as high as 1000
Hz, as in the case of certain midges.How do insects generate power and
maintain coordination at such rapid rates, which challenge the ability of
the nervous system to generate rapid output?Previous work in our lab has
shown that, in Dipteran flies, the wing-wing and wing-haltere coordination
is mediated by mechanical linkages that are embedded within the scutellum
and the sub-epimeral ridge.They further hypothesized that there exists a
?mechanical clutch? at the base of each wing that can be engaged and
disengaged from the thorax, allowing flies to flap just one wing at a
time, as in case of ?courtship songs? in fruit flies.What is the physical
form of this clutch? Does it exist in insect orders other than Diptera?
Are the underlying mechanisms same or different in different insects?
These are the main questions which are driving the study.
At the onset, I wish to compare the Dipteran thorax with the thorax of a
honeybees. Honeybees (Order: Hymenoptera)flap at wing beat frequencies of
200 -250 Hz, and possess asynchronous muscles. They are evolutionarily
distant from Diptera, and possess two pairs of wings unlike Dipterans in
which the hind wings are modified to halteres. Hence they are excellent
systems for comparison with flies, specifically to compare and contrast
the structure and function of wing hinge. We use techniques like high
speed videography and Computed tomography with micrometer resolution to
address the above questions. <br> Selenoprotein N1; a novel regulator of muscle differentiation and
self-renewal </br><br>Selenoprotein N (SelN; encoded by SEPN1 gene) was the first
Selenoprotein associated to a human genetic disease, SEPN1-related
myopathy (SEPN1-RM), which is typified by severe weakness and wasting of
neck and trunk muscles. Previously we have shown that, in human muscle
cells devoid of SelN, there is an increase in intracellular oxidant
activity, protein carbonylation and ROS sensitivity, suggesting that SelN
plays a key role in antioxidant protection. It has also previously shown
that sepn1-/- mice have a reduced rate of muscle repair and a depletion of
the satellite cell (SC) population after injury when compared to wild-type
mice, linking SelN with the balance between self-renewal and
differentiation of the SCs. Here I present my data, thus far, aimed at
elucidating the role and mechanism by which SelN is involved in the
regulatory balance between differentiation and SC self-renewal. Initially
I have demonstrated that in the absence of SelN, myoblasts (MB) have a
stronger myogenic signature, and differentiate more easily in vitro. This
result is also mirrored in the patient samples. Interestingly, the
???stronger??? myogenic appearance of the SelN depleted cells can not be
completely rescued, or induced, by perturbing the cellular redox state,
indicating that SelN has other modes of influence on top of redox
homeostasis. MB cultures with SelN knockdown have a reduced population of
SC-like Pax7+ve reserve cells. Moreover, using a cell suspension induced
quiescence system, these MB cultures appear to be able to enter G0 but
have a more ???activated??? transcription signature. Together this data
implicates SelN in both maintaining the inactivated state of G0 cells and
reducing the susceptibility of the activated cells to mature. Is SelN
working as a differentiation brake? <br> Crosstalk between global transcriptional regulators Fis and CRP in
Escherichia coli </br><br>The initiation of transcription is one of the most important
steps in gene regulation. In this project, we focus on how combinatorial
regulation provided by transcription factors and nucleoid associated
proteins(NAPs) helps in fine tuning gene expression in bacteria during
different growth phases and nutrient conditions. This study aims at
understanding genomic scale crosstalk between global transcriptional
regulator CRP (cyclicAMP Receptor Protein) and nucleoid associated protein
FIS (Factor for Inversion Stimulation) in Escherichia Coli K12 MG1655. In
order to address this question, we created crp and fis single null
mutants, a crpfis double null mutant, and measured their growth in Luria
broth as well as in glucose supplemented media. We proceeded to perform
mRNA-sequencing and chromatin immuno-precipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq)
on these strains, to understand effects on global gene expression as well
as protein-DNA interactions in early exponential and mid exponential
growth phases.
Results indicate that both CRP and Fis are necessary for optimal cell
growth. While minor growth defects are observed in the single mutants,
growth in the double mutant is severely compromised. Transcriptome
analysis of mutants reveals growth phase dependence of CRP and Fis
regulatory activity. Furthermore, the ChIP-Seq study shows the evidence
of Fis occupying CRP binding sites in absence of CRP (and vice-versa) in
regulatory regions important for cell growth, division and metabolism.
Overall, the study indicates that crosstalk between global regulators at
the level of transcription initiation may be an important mechanism in
optimal growth and cell survival. <br> Analysis of the folding pathways of SH3 domains using C-&#945;
and All-atom structure based models for the presence of native-like
intermediates. </br><br>SH3 domains mediate protein-protein interactions in
kinases, lipases, structural proteins and others. They were initially
thought to be two state folders. It has been shown experimentally and
computationally that there exist intermediates in the folding pathways of
these domains. The structure of a native-like intermediate state has been
characterised for Fyn SH3 domain and shown to initiate aggregation. The
current study aims to analyse the folding pathways of four SH3 domains
namely from Src, Fyn, Spectrin and PI3K proteins for the presence of such
intermediates. These domains have an average sequence identity of ~30% but
their structure is conserved. C-&#945; and all-atom structure based models
were used in this analysis. Structure based models are based on principle
of minimum frustration which states that interactions present in the
native structure are strong enough to drive folding. Structures similar to
the Fyn SH3 intermediate were obtained on the folding pathway of the above
mentioned SH3 domains . This underlines the fact that the occurrence of 
this intermediate is solely due to the structure of the SH3 domain. <br> Prion-like domain mediated neuronal RNP granule assembly and its
role in Memory </br><br>Long-term synaptic plasticity requires the presence of
translationally suppressed subsets of mRNAs whose translation is induced
by appropriate local synaptic activity. The underlying translational
control events are governed by mRNA interactions with RNA binding proteins
(RBPs) and the properties of the resultant mRNA-protein complexes (mRNPs).
In vivo, these mRNPs are found in "granules" or "mRNP assemblies," because
individual mRNPs tend to reversibly assemble into aggregates via
aggregation-prone, prion-like domains found frequently on RBPs. In
neurons, this regulated assembly and disassembly of mRNPs are required for
long-term memory (LTM) and neuronal maintenance.
I am currently testing a hypothesis in which neuronal RNP granule proteins
with prioin-like domains bind mRNAs and inhibit translation at resting
synapses and upon stimulation this gets reversed leading to mRNP
disassembly, facilitating active translation that contributes to neuronal
modifications necessary for memory. We hypothesize that, the mutations
that cause decreased assembly will lead to memory defects and the
mutations that will enhance the assembly will cause neurodegeneration.
Among several neuronal prion-like domain RNA granule proteins, Atx2 has
been shown to be required for granule formation and LTM (PNAS, 36:108,
2011; PNAS, 1:111, 2013). Moreover mutations in prion-like domain of this
proteins cause neurodegenerative disease.In this AWS, I will present the
outcome of the findings,where we have perturbed the prion-like domains in
Atx2 protein both in vivo in flies as well as in S2 cells. The loss of
prion-like domain of Atx2 is non-lethal to flies as compared to the
protein null, but we see a significant reduction in RNP granules in S2
cells and fly brain. This reduction in RNP granules correlate to the LTM,
as tested with odor habituation assay, suggesting a functional relation
between RNP aggregation and memory. We have generated transgenic
gRNAfliesfor Atx2 and tested the knockout efficiencies with CRISPR. We are
currently performing spatiotemporal gene knock out to study translation
control, RNP aggregation and behavior. <br> Investigating the Role of Shaker K+ Channel in Drosophila
Hematopoiesis </br><br>Blood development in Drosophila melanogaster is regulated
by signals and cell interaction within the hematopoietic organ. In
addition to signals from the niche and differentiated cells, there are
systemic signals which help maintain the progenitors. The brain is able to
sense information like nutriti on and olfaction and relays systemic cues
to the progenitors to maintain their population . Preliminary data
suggests that Shaker (Sh) which encodes the alpha subunit of voltage
dependent potassium ion (K + ) and other components Of this channel
control blood development. Given the nature of functions performed by
Shaker or potassium ion channels in regulating neuronal function, we
hypothesized that Sh regulates neuronal signalling events that are
essential for hematopoietic development and behaviour. My data supports
this and suggests that Sh could be important in specific regions of the
brain which control blood development. In addition to this non ?autonomous
function of Sh in the neurons , I have also identified Sh expression
specifically in the undifferentiated multipotent progenitors, using an
antibody against Sh protein. This now also opens the possibility of an
autonomous function of Sh ion channels in blood progenitor development.
Taken together, my preliminary findings suggest both a non -autonomous and
an autonomous control of Sh function in blood development, which I will
investigate in my PhD . Through this work I hope to identify neuronal
circuits and players key to the process of hematopoiesis and their
physiological relevance <br> Unraveling the role of disease linked mutations present in the
N-terminal region of Prion protein </br><br>Prion diseases are a group of fatal neurodegenerative
disorders, in which the conformational transitions of native prion protein
to a misfolded form causes aggregation and neurodegeneration. Prion
diseases can be sporadic, familial and infectious in nature. In genetic or
familial diseases, single point mutations in the PRNP gene can increase
the propensity of aggregation and neurodegeneration. These mutations might
be having effects on prion protein stability, processing and/or cellular
interactions to various molecules like lipid membrane, which leads to
aggregation and development of diseases. These pathogenic mutations are
present throughout the PRNP gene and mainly clustered in the C-terminal
region of prion protein. It has been shown that mutations present in the
C-terminal region affects the thermodynamic stability and the native state
dynamics of prion protein which eventually increases the propensity for
aggregation. However, there is very little evidences are available for a
direct molecular effect of the mutations present in the unstructured
N-terminal region of the prion protein. In this AWS, I will discuss the
membrane interaction features and aggregation properties of some of the
pathogenic mutations present in the N-terminal unstructured region of
prion protein. <br> Phosphoinositides: potential role in wing venation patterning </br><br>Adult wing development from imaginal discs is regulated by
signalling via morphogens. Intracellular transport mechanisms are likely
to be important not only for morphogen secretion but also for the response
of target cells in the wing disc to these molecules. Lipids are central
players in cellular transport not only as inert cargo containers but also
in their capacity to modulate transport in developing cells.
Phosphoinositides, are such a class signalling lipids.Previously I had
shown that knockdown of PI4K III&#61537;in the anterio-posterior
compartmentresulted in eitherloss of or perturbation of ACV. In mammalian
cells it has been postulated that PI4KIII&#61537;is a component of a
complex that contain proteins named TTC7 and Efr3 amongst others. I have
shown that knocking down TTC7 using ptc-Gal4 has similar venation defect
as that of PI4KIII&#61537;.I will present experimental data on the further
analysis of PI4KIII&#61537;and associated protein such as Efr3 and
morphogen signalling as I try to map the wing vein loss phenotype to the
pathway(s) that are affected to give rise to anterior cross vein loss. <br> Role of FMRP in neuronal differentiation </br><br>Loss of FMRP (Fragile x mental retardation protein) leads to
fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited form of intellectual
deficiency. Absence of FMRP affects both neuronal differentiation and
plasticity but the function of FMRP is studied exclusively in mature
neuron/brain. Our primary goal is to understand the function of FMRP in
pluripotent stem cells and its role in differentiation to neurons.We
searched for FMRP target mRNAs in human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and
neuronal precursor cells (NPC) derived from them and to our surprise we
found differential association of FMRP with many of its target mRNAs. One
such interesting candidate was Arc (Activity regulated cytoskeleton
protein). Arc is important in neuronal plasticity, development of the
embryo and survival as well as maturation of NPC. FMRP is a translational
repressor for Arc mRNA in neurons and absence of FMRP leads to increased
basal translation of Arc mRNA in neurons. In accordance to this we found
that there is very little association of FMRP with Arc mRNA in NPC as
compared to ESC and correspondingly more translation in NPC as compared to
ESC. Surprisingly, contrary to the prediction, we found that in absence of
FMRP in the ESC, there is very little translation of Arc. This indicates
that depending upon the context, FMRP can be a translational repressor or
promoter of Arc. The mechanism by which FMRP is able to bring about this
dual role and the physiological implication of this is currently under
study. <br> Network Dynamics of Memory and Learning </br><br>Memory is a process in which information is encoded in a form
which can be stored and retrieved reproducibly. Along with neocortex,
hippocampus plays a very important role in formation and maintenance of
short term and episodic memory. Due to its very well characterized and
distinct neuronal networks, hippocampus is also a major model for studying
memory, plasticity and learning. There are several theoretical models
proposed to explain the working of hippocampal memory but most of them are
still to be verified experimentally in living systems and on the scale of
the whole hippocampus as well as its surrounding regions of brain. One of
the cell layers in hippocampus, namely CA3 is hypothesized to store memory
in form of attractor networks because of its extensive auto-associative
connections. But another layer CA1, which is collateral and downstream to
CA3, is not very well known in its functions. The research objectives of
present study are to determine the network dynamics of hippocampal memory
formation, in context of the role of individual neurons and group of
neurons in a network and proposing an experimentally verified model for
the phenomenon. In the initial phase of my research, I have been working
on standardization of hippocampal sections to be used for in-vitro
experiments. It is observed that the cytoarchitecture depends majorly on
the plane of sectioning of the hippocampus. This can be seen in the field
electrical activity. I will be using optogenetic and electrophysiological
approaches for further experiments. In this annual work seminar, I will be
presenting the background of the problem and my current work setup and
future directions. <br> PPCheck: A Webserver for the Quantitative Analysis of
Protein?Protein Interfaces and Prediction of Residue Hotspots </br><br>Protein?protein interactions (PPIs) are important in
carrying out many biological processes and functions. These interactions
may be either permanent or of temporary nature. We have have developed an
objective algorithm, called PPCheck, to measure the strength of
interactions at protein-protein interfaces. Modeling these PPIs using
docking algorithms is useful for understanding biomolecular interactions
and mechanisms. Typically, a docking algorithm generates a large number
of docking poses, and it is often challenging to select the best
native-like pose. A further challenge is to recognize key residues, termed
as hotspots, at protein?protein interfaces, which contribute more energy
than other residues in stabilizing a protein?protein interface.
Native-like poses could be successfully identified in 27 out of 30 test
cases, when applied on a set of decoys that were generated using FRODOCK.
PPCheck, along with conservation and accessibility scores, was able to
differentiate ?native-like and non-native-like poses from 1883 decoys of
Critical Assessment of Prediction of Interactions (CAPRI) targets with an
accuracy of 60%. PPCheck was optimized on a 10-fold mixed training dataset
and tested on a 10-fold mixed set for hotspot prediction. We obtain an
accuracy of 72%, which is in par with other methods, and a sensitivity of
59%, which is better than most existing methods available for hotspot
prediction that uses similar datasets. Other relevant tests suggest that
PPCheck can also be reliably used to identify conserved residues in a
protein complex and to perform computational alanine scanning.

10.1039/c3mb25484d. Epub 2013 Mar 27. <br> Function Can Modulate the Mechanism of Domain Swapping </br><br>Despite having similar structures
(beta1-alpha1-beta2-beta3-beta4-beta5), the cysteine protease inhibitor,
stefin-B and sweet-tasting protein, monellin, differ in their folding
mechanism and domain-swapping propensity. It has been shown using
computational folding models that the mechanisms of protein folding and
that of domain swapping are closely connected. Here, the folding of
monellin and stefin-B is investigated using all-atom structure-based
models and molecular dynamics simulations to understand the molecular
basis that cause such differences. It is found that monellin folds
cooperatively with a single barrier separating the folded and the unfolded
states. Stefin-B however populates an intermediate
(beta2-beta3-beta4-beta5) which closely resembles one of the swapped
regions in the domain-swapped structure. In stefin-B the backbone dihedral
of VAL48 (involved in protease binding) shifts from a disallowed region of
the Ramachandran map when folded as a monomer to a allowed region in the
domain-swapped structure. Upon encoding this effect in stefin-B a new
intermediate with beta3-beta4-beta5 folded gets populated which exactly
mimics one of the swapped region. We conclude that the function of
monellin which is spread over the protein can accommodate cooperative
folding while the more localized functional residues (in N-terminal, loop1
and loop2) as exhibited in stefin-B promote the formation of a
folding-intermediate which in turn can lead to domain swapping and
aggregation. Thus, the mechanism of aggregation is observed to be a direct
consequence of the constraints that function imposes on a protein. <br> Development of an algorithm for Protein-Protein Docking, protocol
for the identification of near native pose in a High performance computing
environment for large-scale docking studies </br><br>Protein-protein docking studies have acquired lot of
importance in the area of structural biology and become an important tool
for identifying proper targets for many drug development studies. Hence,
the prediction of near-native geometrical structure of complexes of two or
more proteins from the unbound monomers is in high demand. We have
developed a collection of tools and pipelines for docking, identification
of near-native pose, validation of right interaction and analysis of
various interactions in huge macromolecular assemblies. Since various
methods involved in these tools demand huge computing resources, such as
high processing capacity and memory, tools are designed to work in a High
Performance Computing (HPC) environment through parallel processing
technologies like threading and forking. We also have developed and
implemented RESTFul webservice APIs for the programmatic access of these
tools to enable large-scale docking studies. We have performed a testing
and training of the tools by analyzing about 2000 known protein dimer
complexes. One of the basic tools, named CAPSDock, performs the
geometrical complementarity search, identification of the near native pose
and validation of the interactions. Another tool, named PIMA, analyzes all
possible interactions in huge macromolecular assemblies to present the
intricate details of interactions as network diagrams, thereby making them
user-interrogative and conceptually easy to visualise. <br> Understanding the mechanistic basis for a universal insecticidefrom an ancient Indian medicinal plant. </br><br><p>Insects depend on chemical cues to survive and interact in their complex environments (to locate food, mate etc.). Recently, a new compound has been extracted from aerial parts of Artemisia pallens which is a putative universal insecticide. The compound is toxic to several species of insects when applied as a fumigant, yet its mode of action is not clear. Electrophysiological experiments revealed that several diverse insect species can detect this compound using olfaction. Our goal is to determine the mechanistic basis of the olfactory detection of this compound, and understand its role in the ecology and evolution of insects. For this, we have used various approaches such as toxicology and behavioral bio-assays of several species, neurogenetics, and electrophysiological recordings from insect olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). In future, we will proceed with molecular and bioinformatics analysis to elucidate the specific molecular and cellular interactions of this compound with the olfactory system. Today, I will present some of the preliminary data and future prospects of this study.</p> <br> Distribution of Himalayan pikas </br><br>Most species are confined to small areas with limits to their
geographic distribution. The distribution limits could be influenced by
abrupt spatial change or gradual waning of opportunities or competition
between species. Heterogeneous landscape of mountains sets limit to
distribution of biota in the form of gradual changes in environmental
conditions and abrupt spatial change in the form of deep gorges, limiting
their range. We studied distribution of pikas, a montane endemic small
mammalian species along the latitudinal and altitudinal gradients of the
Himalaya to understand their habitat and geographic extent of
distribution. We found elevational segregation between closely related
species and the segregation appeared stronger for younger species within
sub-genus Ochotona. This preliminary study shows some evidence that the
pattern of diversity of Himalayan pikas is driven by the heterogeneity of
Himalayan landscape and perhaps competition between the species. This
study sets stage for future research to understand the impacts of
increasing global temperature on pika species occupying different regions
in the Himalaya. <br> Effect of Acute Stress and Social Stress on the dendritic spine
plasticity </br><br>Stress is a disruption in the homeostasis of the body and the
physiological changes in response to stress may lead to changes in the way
an organism perceives its environment. Earlier studies from our laboratory
have shown that when rodents were subjected to a single episode of stress,
Acute Immobilisation Stress (AIS) (2hrs), and tested for their anxiety
levels a day later, there was no anxiety seen in these animals, But
strikingly when these animals were tested after a delay of ten days, there
was increased anxiety shown at the behavioral level in the form of
decreased open arm exploration in the elevated plus maze (EPM), which was
accompanied by increased spine density at the structural level in the
basolateral amygdala (BLA). Various clinical studies and animal models of
chronic stress studies implicate that there are three main regions
involved in stress and memory circuitry, amygdala, hippocampus and medial
prefrontal cortex (mPFC). I wanted to explore the delayed effects of AIS
on the spine morphology in hippocampus and mPFC. Results show that the
spine number decreases in hippocampus (both in CA1 and CA3 region) and in
infralimbic region of mPFC and no change seen in prelimbic region of mPFC.
In another project, I am focusing on a different kind of stress model,
Social Defeat Stress (SDS). SDS is one of the most important stress models
used to mimic human stress related psychopathologies. Resident Intruder
paradigm is used to study this kind of stress model. An intruder male rat
is introduced into the resident?s cage and it?s been attacked and defeated
by the resident male rat. The interaction between the resident rat with
the intruder rat is assessed for 10 minutes and offensive and the social
behavior of the resident rat was analysed. The brains were then subjected
to morphological analysis. The preliminary results show that there is no
change in spine number in the basolateral region of amygdala (BLA), but I
see that the spine number decreases in the aggressive rats in the dorsal
part the medial amygdala (MePD) which play an important role in the social
behavior. <br> SOCE is required in pair of dopaminergic neurons for Drosophila
Flight </br><br>Store Operated Calcium Entry (SOCE) is thought to primarily
regulate calcium homeostasis in neurons. Subsequent to identification of
Orai as the SOCE channel and STIM as ER calcium sensor in non-excitable
cells, investigation of Orai and STIM function in neurons demonstrated a
requirement for SOCE in the Drosophila flight circuit. To further
investigate the role of SOCE in Drosophila flight circuit we generated a
dominant negative form of Drosophila Orai and tissue specific knock out of
STIM. Controlled tissue specific expression of the dominant-negative
Drosophila Orai transgene and knockout of STIM showed that SOCE is
required in dopaminergic neurons of the flight circuit during pupal
development. The loss of SOCE alters the transcriptional profile of
dopaminergic neurons. In pupae, during flight circuit maturation, loss of
SOCE results in down-regulation of Tyrosine Hydroxylase which is essential
for dopamine synthesis and dopamine transporter (required for uptake of
dopamine after synaptic release) and upregulation of Cac1 (a voltage gated
calcium channel) supporting a role for SOCE in regulation of neural
excitability in dopaminergic neurons of the flight circuit. These studies
suggest that modulation of SOCE could serve as a novel mechanism for
restoring dopaminergic specificity and/or neural activity to neurons in
neurodegenerative disorders. <br> Signaling in muscle cell quiescence: cross-talk between
Wnt/TGF&#946; pathways </br><br>Quiescent adult stem cells in skeletal muscle are known as
satellite cells, and play a critical role in homeostatic repair and
regeneration after injury. During postnatal development, satellite cells
exit the cell cycle to a reversibly arrested phase known as quiescence or
G0, and return to this state after damage-induced proliferation, repair
and regeneration are complete. Signals that activate satellitecells to
proliferate and/or differentiate are known, but the pathways used to
attain and maintain the quiescent state are still poorly characterized. To
study the molecular mechanisms involved in quiescence we use (i) freshly
isolated muscle fibers with associated satellite cells and (ii) a culture
model in which skeletal muscle myoblasts (C2C12) are reversibly arrested
in G0. Previous studiesfrom our lab showed that quiescent myoblasts
display a strong transcriptional signatureof the canonical Wnt pathway
including induction of endogenous Tcf target genes and an exogenously
introduced Tcf/Lef reporter.Enhancing Wnt signaling or perturbing
downstream Wnt/Tcf targets disrupted the quiescence program in culture. In
canonical Wnt signaling, Tcf/Lef factors cooperate with &#946; -catenin to
activate target genes. In my studies, using perturbations of the Wnt
pathway at multiple levels,Ihave foundthat Tcf/Lef mediated target gene
activation in quiescent state in culture is independent of &#946;-catenin.
 Interestingly, perturbation of another quiescence-inducedsignaling
pathway-TGF&#946;, and its mediator Smad3,not only dampens the
transcriptional activation of Tcf/lef reporter but also endogenousTcf
target genes. These observationssuggest cross talk ofTGF&#946;/Smad3
signaling, bypassing Wnt pathway components for Tcf/Lef mediated target
gene activation. In concurrence with the in vitro data,we find that
quiescent satellite cell nucleiin vivo also show the co-localization of
Smad3 and Tcf/Lef factors.Ongoing work is aimed at dissectingthe
mechanisms of Tcf/Lef mediated target gene activation by TGF&#946;/Smad3
pathway independent of conventional Wnt/&#946;-catenin pathway.My
long-term goal is to understand how TGF-Wnt cross talk may trigger entry
into quiescence. <br> DARPP-32 expression patterns in larval and adult zebrafish brain </br><br>One of the interests in our lab is the effect of dopamine on
larval swimming behaviour in zebra fish. One of the potential key
molecules in this context is the dopaminergic and cyclic adenosine
3???5??? monophosphate regulated neuronal phosphoprotein (DARPP-32).
DARPP-32 belongs to the family of regulatory subunits of protein
phosphatise 1(PP1) and has been shown to have an obligatory role in the
integration of dopaminergic signalling in medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of
the basal ganglia in mouse and rat. However, not much is known about its
physiological function in intact neural circuits and its potential role
during the establishment of neural circuits. Taking advantage of the
excellent experimental opportunities the zebra fish offers, we are
investigating the effect of DARPP-32 on circuit formation and functioning.
We started by characterizing the expression of DARPP-32 on the genetic,
mRNA and protein level during the early stages of development. We found
three different isoforms of DARPP-32 expressed at the mRNA level, two of
them throughout the course of development into adult stages.
Immunofluorescence staining on whole mount zebra fish larva revealed that
DARPP-32 protein is highly expressed in Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum
3 days post fertilization onwards. We also found DARPP-32 to be expressed
in the optic tectum, the adenohypophysis and in the pronephrus duct from
larval stages onward. We then established the distribution of DARPP-32
protein in the adult zebra fish brain. Immunofluorescence staining on
coronal and sagittal sections of the adult
brain showed DARPP-32 protein expression in all cerebellum-like structures
known in teleosts additional to the expression in Purkinje neurons. We are
now planning to look further into the role DARPP-32 plays in these
particular circuits. <br> Control of glycan synthesis through compartmentalization of enzymes </br><br>Eukaryotic o-glycans are branched sugar modifications
attached to lipids and proteins post-synthesis. Many glycosyltransferases,
the enzymes used to synthesize glycans, allow branching and
polymerization, which result in a large repertoire of products. This seems
to conflict with the experimental observation that the set of glycans
actually expressed by a particular cell type is limited. In our model,
subsets of glycosyltransferases are compartmentalized the Golgi, and this
functions as a control mechanism that produces a heterogeneous yet limited
set of glycan products. <br> Understanding the mechanism of wound induced stem cell mobilization </br><br>Tissue damage leads to the activation of a wound healing
response in order to restore the structural and functional integrity of
the tissue. Activation and mobilization of resident stem cells in the
injured tissue accelerate the recovery of the normal cellular repertoire
of the wounded tissue. Questions that have stymied the field of wound
repair include: 1. What are the signals that regulate this emergency
recruitment of stem cells into the wounded tissue?;and 2.What is the
molecular basis of this homing behavior? These questions gain importance
in light of the fact that in wound healing disorders, such cellular
responses are impaired. A promising therapeutic strategy would thus be to
manipulate the mobilization of these resident stem cells in order to
stimulate the rapid repair of adult tissues.
I am addressing these questions by studying wound healing in the skin,
whichhas the ability to rapidly regenerate following injury owing to the
mobilization of many resident stem cells.Epithelial stem cells such as
themultipotent hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) localized in the hair
follicles outlining the wound margin are redirected to the epidermis to
advance the wound repair process..The extracellular cue(s) and subsequent
molecular regulation of HFSC homing is unknown thus forming the main
objectives of my research. To address these questions I am studying the
HFSC mobilization in a mouse model where the entire skin shows a
wound-healing phenotype. Preliminary data suggest that soluble chemotactic
cues arise from the epidermis of the skin, primarily from the stressed
keratinocytes.Keratinocyte stress leads to the release of
interleukin1-alpha (IL-1&#61537;) and other factors in a
caspase-1dependent manner. Experiments reveal that HFSC epidermal homing
is inhibited upon caspase-1 loss in an (IL-1&#61537;) independent manner.
This suggests either a direct role of extracellular caspase-1as a
chemotactic factor or an indirect role where it leads to the release of a
chemotactic factor. Future experiments will be discussed aimed at
deciphering these. <br> Evolutionary patterns of GC content and tRNA copy number acrossbacteria </br><br><p>In this AWS, I will describe some phylogenetic patterns in two<br />important genomewide properties of bacteria- GC content and tRNA copy<br />numbers. GC content is a naturally fundamental property of genomes,<br />although it is not clear if it constitutes a meaningful "phenotype" by<br />itself. In any case, bacterial genomes display enormous variation in their<br />GC content ranging from 15% GC to 75% GC. This variation constrains<br />functional properties like codon usage and amino acid usage, potentially<br />influencing protein properties and horizontal gene transfer. How bacterial<br />genomes come to have such varying GC content is an unsolved mystery.<br />Although mutational biases, selection, biased gene conversion have been<br />investigated as the potential factors determining GC content, inferences<br />have been equivocal owing to confounding influence from phylogenetic<br />relatedness. I have begun describing trends and variation of GC content<br />across different bacterial clades in the hope of finding independent<br />instances of transitions in GC content. This could help us to make more<br />meaningful associations between the phenotype and the explanatory<br />variables.<br />The copy numbers of tRNA genes are thought to undergo co-evolution with<br />the usage of corresponding codons in a genome. In many different clades,<br />we see that closely related bacteria vary significantly in their tRNA copy<br />numbers, despite overall codon usage being conserved. An interesting<br />possibility is that tRNA copy numbers are following set of "important"<br />genes. I will present results of preliminary investigations in this<br />direction.</p> <br> Effects of chronic stress on innate responses to rat ultrasonic
vocalization (USV) playbacks </br><br>Emotions and emotional states of the organism have been
extensively studied in the past few decades. Grossly, the basic emotional
state of an organism can be viewed as comprising of negative (e.g.,
fear) and positive (e.g.,) states. Most of the models used to study
emotional states of the organism are based on learned responses of the
subject, which fail to capture the innate emotional responses. Also, the
cues and conditions employed by the models are not ethologically relevant.
 So, in order to address these issues, we are trying to develop a
behavioural paradigm in the lab. To do the same, I have used playbacks of
rat ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) which serve as ethologically critical
social signals and offer a unique window into the emotional state of the
organism. Additionally, I have been using the same paradigm to gain
insights into effects of chronic immobilization stress (CIS) on innate
responses of the organism as opposed to conditioned/learned responses
which have been studied quite extensively. In this talk, I will be
discussing about the behavioural paradigm and some preliminary results
from same. <br> To determine the role of neuromodulation in habituation in
Drosophila melanogaster </br><br>Prolonged exposure of an animal to a sensory stimulus leads
to reduction in response to that particular stimulus. This is a form of
non associative learning called habituation. Depending on the environment
of an organism, learning can be modified which is mediated by
neuromodulators that are a specific class of neurotransmitters. The aim of
my study is to determine the role of neuromodulation in regulating
habituation in olfactory and gustatory system of Drosophila. Sensory
neurons gather information from the environment. Local interneurons
process this information and projection neurons send the processed
information to higher brain centres. Previous studies in our lab suggest
that habituation takes place through strengthening of inhibition of
projection neurons by local interneurons. Habituation also requires
rutabaga, a Ca2+ dependent adenylate cyclase, in inhibitory local
interneurons. Since adenylate cyclase acts downstream of GPCR signalling,
neuromodulators could be playing a role in mediating habituation as they
act through GPCR. Our preliminary data suggests that activating
neuromodulatory neurons blocks olfactory habituation. Also we have
observed that flies do not show gustatory habituation to bitter taste
compound. We are investigating if this behaviour is mediated by
neuromodulators as habituation needs to be gated so that organisms do not
habituate to potentially harmful stimuli. <br> A humanized mouse model for studying inherited cardiomyopathies
caused by mutations in sarcomeric genes </br><br>The major isoforms of cardiac myosin heavy chain (MHC)
expressed in the ventricles of mice differ from those in humans. Mice
express the faster alpha isoform (Myh6) whereas humans and other larger
animals express the slower beta isoform (MYH7). Existing mouse models of
inherited cardiomyopathies either have the human mutations introduced into
the endogenous mouse alpha myosin or express mutant beta myosin as a
transgene. Studies which have compared the same cardiomyopathy mutant in
alpha versus beta MHC have shown contrasting effects in the two cases
(Lowey et al., JBC, 2008; Lowey et al., JBC, 2013). To overcome these
problems we have replaced the coding region of the mouse alpha-myosin
heavy chain locus (Myh6) with the coding region of the human beta-myosin
heavy chain locus (MYH7), including introns and the microRNA genes that
control MHC expression. This should provide a better and more accurate
mouse model for cardiomyopathy caused by MYH7 mutations, the largest
single cause of inherited cardiomyopathy. Our mouse model should help in
the understanding of primary initial effects of these mutations and their
progression over the course of the disease leading to remodelling of the
heart.
Homozygous mice (Myh6humMYH7/Myh6humMYH7) die in utero, however,
heterozygotes (Myh6humMYH7/Myh6+) survive and show 50% expression each of
the mouse alpha and human beta-MHC isoforms. The human beta isoform is
expressed in the cardiac myofibrils of the heterozygous mice and is
incorporated into the sarcomere precisely at the M line. Functionally, the
heterozygous mice show no significant differences relative to wild-type
controls, appearing at the correct Mendelian ratios with no difference in
mortality rates. The heterozygotes show no significant differences in
physiological hypertrophic response to voluntary exercise and pathological
hypertrophic response to isoproterenol infusion, measured by left
ventricle mass-to-tibia-length ratio, heart rate, and expression of
relevant genes by qPCR.
These observations, when considered in the context of an earlier study
(Jones et al., J Clin Invest 1996) that showed heterozygous Myh6 knockout
mice display defects in cardiac contractility and sarcomeric disarray,
suggest that the human MYH7 appears to be rescuing cardiac function in our
heterozygous humanized mice. As such our heterozygous humanized mice could
be an improved model for the study of cardiomyopathy-causing dominant
mutations in mice. <br> Variability in encoding new spatial information in waggle dancecommunication by individual honey bees, Apis mellifera. </br><br><p>Honey bee foragers communicate spatial location of food sources to nest-mates with the unique dance language behavior. The waggle-run duration correlates with the distance of the food source from the hive. So far, all studies investigating this correlation were done with groups of bees. However, averaged responses of multiple individuals do not necessarily show what is actually happening at the level of the individuals. So we investigated dance behavior of individual bees. We asked how consistent are waggle run durations for a given feeder distance? How do waggle run durations for the same feeder differ among individuals? How fast does an individual update its waggle run durations when a feeder is moved to a different location? How far does one need to move the feeder to see a significant change in waggle run durations? We have finished the experiments and I will present an overview of the current state of analysis.</p> <br> Understanding the molecular mechanism of action of multi-domain
phosphatidylinositol transfer protein in vivo </br><br>Phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PITPs) are proteins
capable of binding and transferring single molecule of
phosphatidylinositol (PI) between membranes in vitro. These are expressed
in all eukaryotes and have been identified as key players in numerous
signalling pathways relying on phosphatidylinositol (PI) metabolites.
Notably they are required for required for regulated exocytosis, for
receptor-stimulated turnover of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate
(PIP2) by phospholipaseC (PLC), for phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)
activity, and for budding of immature secretory granules from the trans
Golgi network. Although PITPs have been implicated as essential co-factors
required to support several signalling events that involve PIP2 turnover,
the basis of their requirement during physiological signalling is not
clear. My work aims to try and understand the mechanism of action of PITPs
in vivo, using Drosophila photoreceptors (PRs) as a model system.
Drosophila PRs express a multi-domain PITP namely RDGB. In my previous
presentation, I had shown data that shows that RDGB function is essential
to maintain levels of PIP2 and phosphatidic acid (PA) during
phototransduction. It transfers both PI and PA across the PM-ER contact
site. In this presentation I will show results that demonstrate that RDGB
has restricted localization within photoreceptors and it has functional
relevance. The PITP domain itself lacks membrane anchoring signal and
therefore is unable to meet the physiological demand during strong PLC
stimulation. I will also present data which shows that the FFAT motif of
RDGB is critical for its in vivo localization. Overall the data suggests
that the evolution of multi-domain PITPs imparts regulation on the PITP
domain activity and hence has physiological relevance. <br> Developing locally injectable cationic hydrogels for dual
delivery of nucleic acids and low molecular-weight drugs for the treatment
of joint inflammatory disorders. </br><br>Joint inflammation due to internal bleeding episodes is
observed in patients with severe hemophilia where coagulation factor less
than 1% is present. Recurrent internal bleeding causes irreversible
catabolic destruction of synovial sites and cartilage leading to
inflammation. NF-KB and its associated pathways are found to be the
molecular pathogenesis of blood induced joint inflammation in murine
hemophilic models. Cytokines found in the synovial arthropathy also
recapitulates the inflammatory markers found in other inflammatory
arthritic conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus
erythamatosus(SLE). Intensive prophylactic factor replacement therapy used
for treating hemophilic bleeding is not effective in controlling this
severe co-morbidity termed as hemophilic arthropathy. Intra-articular
injection of factor proteins and anti-inflammatory drugs showed reduced
inflammation and joint scores. However, this approach has limitations such
as escape of injected drugs from the joints which leads to repeated
injections to gain prolonged effect, this is not ideal for hemophilic
patients. Also, the method adapted controls only the inflammation rather
than correcting the systemic coagulation pathways. We hypothesize that
controlled release of anti-inflammatory drug intra-articularly could
provide an efficient way of controlling arthropathy. In the same time,
factor gene therapy in the joints would be an ideal way to control the
further bleeding. To achieve a single platform which can provide
controlled release of anti-inflammatory drug and at the same time act as a
gene delivery vehicle, we have designed cationic hydrogels. Thus far, we
have developed cationic amphiphiles that can form hydrogels and
encapsulate nucleic acids. <br> Learning induced activity sequences in the brain </br><br>Animals have the ability to learn causal relationships between
events that are separated in time but repeatedly occur one after the
other. This kind of associative learning is called trace learning. We are
interested to find out the neuronal mechanisms that underlie trace
learning. We attempt to train mice on a trace conditioning paradigm and
then look at the calcium activity of neurons in the CA1 region of the
hippocampus. This part of the brain is imperative for trace learning.
Previous work from the lab has found that trace learning causes cells of
the CA1 region of the hippocampus to converge to a time locked, sequencial
firing. Currently we are trying to observe this phenomenon in a chronic
manner by recording from the same animal for multiple days. This will
allow us to address a lot of interesting questions which i shall discuss.
I will talk about the setup that we are using to achieve this kind of
chronic recordings. This will have two sections- the behaviour setup and
the chronic implants that enable us to take two photon images of
hippocampal neurons
Finally I will show optical recoring that we managed to get very recently. <br> Scenarios of development increase probability of tiger
extinctions in India within a century </br><br>Habitat loss is the major cause of population decline in most
carnivores. Tigers have lost 93 % of their habitat over the last 200
years and are currently restricted to protected areas and forest fragments
amongst agriculture and high human densities. While the total numbers of
tigers in India have increased in the last ten years, only 10 protected
areas have more than 50 individuals, and the median population size is 19.
In addition, there are debates about whether or not tiger connectivity can
be maintained under projected Indian human population growth. In this
study, we examined current population connectivity across 9 reserves in
Central India. We used the genetic data to infer the
resistance-to-movement across different landuse types. We then modeled
landscapes 100 years into the future using different landuse-change
criteria. We assessed impacts of the future scenarios on population
connectivity and tiger extinction using spatially-explicit,
individually-based, landscape genetics simulations. While our results
suggest that tigers will not go extinct in this entire landscape, our
results confirm that connectivity between populations will decrease with
high risk of local extinction in small and/or isolated populations and
loss of genetic diversity. We emphasize that conservation efforts should
not be limited to inside protected areas but be directed towards tiger
landscapes. Our results provide hope and can be used to prioritize
mitigation efforts associated with development activities, providing a
scientific link between conservation and development policy. <br> ?An in-vitro bottom-up approach to understand the role of dynamic
actin filaments on molecular patterning of plasma membrane components.? </br><br>The plasma membrane defines the boundaries of a cell. Control of
local membrane composition and shape are important for it to constantly
engage with the outside world. Previous work has revealed a role for
dynamic acto-myosin in membrane organization, suggesting that the cell
surface behaves as an active composite composed of a fluid lipid bilayer
and a thin-film of active acto-myosin.
We reconstituted an analogous system in vitro consisting of a supported
lipid bilayer coupled via membrane-associated actin binding proteins to
actin filaments and myosin motors. We found that actin and myosin upon
consumption of ATP form a dynamic self-organizing network, which in turn
induces active fluctuations of coupled membrane components, resembling
those observed at the cell surface.
These results highlight the fundamental basis of the active composite
model of the cell surface and indicate its relevance to the study of
membrane organization. To elaborate this system and to gain further
microscopic understanding of the forces and currents leading to the
nanoscale pattern formation of membrane components, we plan to study the
role of differential coupling of cell membrane components to F-actin, and
test the effect of different motor proteins and actin modulators on
actin-driven molecular patterning.
In this AWS, I'll mostly talk about the first question, i.e., affinity
based segregation of membrane components. For that purpose, I developed a
TIRF based Single molecule assay to determine the affinities of different
actin binding proteins. I'll also talk about other experimental strategies
that we have started to address the above mentioned questions. <br> Structural Basis for Anti-Recombination Activity of MutS2 </br><br>Homologous recombination (HR) is responsible for the
integration of exogenous DNA and rearrangements in the genome. This
process has to be regulated so that genomic arrangements do not occur at a
frequency that can compromise genetic viability. MutS2, in H.pylori, has
been shown to suppress HR and thus, probably serves to calibrate the
frequency of genomic rearrangements. I aim to unearth the structural basis
of the anti-recombination activity of MutS2. In this AWS, I will present
the progress made towards this end in the last 6 months. <br> Lower and Upper Bounds in Theoretical Connectomics </br><br>A connectome is a wiring diagram that describes the exact
connectivity of neurons in the nervous system of an organism. A number of
efforts are currently underway to determine the connectome or parts
thereof in a variety of organisms. However, given that such efforts will
yield only the anatomy of the neural circuits without telling us the
detailed physiology of the individual neurons, it is as yet unclear to
what extent this knowledge will inform us about mechanistic computation
occurring in the said circuits. I?ve been building theoretical machinery
to help understand constraints that the anatomy of a neural circuit places
on what it can compute. In previous work (with A. Banerjee), I?ve looked
at this question in feedforward networks, where we showed examples of
specific spike-timed computations that networks of certain specific
architectures could not perform, when one only assumes a small number of
properties that the neurons therein are constrained to obey.
 Here, I will present additional theoretical tools and notions to address
these questions. The idea is to study the space of all possible
spike-train to spike-train transformations. In particular, I am
interested in asking how the subset of transformations spanned by
networks of specific architectures can be related to subsets of the space
that are characterized by particular properties of transformations. After
introducing some new definitions that form the framework, I will present
some results of this form. <br> Stimulating T cell activation with DNA-based receptors and ligands </br><br>The adaptive immune response requires that T cell lymphocytes
respond to foreign antigens but ignore self-peptides^ref .This process
begins with an interaction between the T cell receptor (TCR) on the T
cell and a peptide-loaded MHC molecule on the antigen presenting cell.
Previous studies have implicated the lifetime of TCR-pMHC bond as a key
determinant in discriminating between activating and non-activating pMHC
molecules**^ref **. However, the mechanism by which TCR-pMHC bound life
time is converted into an all or none signal for T cell activation is
poorly understood. Here, we have developed a synthetic receptor-ligand
system in which the extracellular domains of the TCR and pMHC are replaced
with interacting strands of DNA .By varying the Watson-Crick base pairing,
we show that the T cell signaling response is sensitive to differences in
binding energy at the level of single hydrogen bonds. In contrast to
expectations, we find that a long receptor-ligand bound life-time by
itself is insufficient to trigger the phosphorylation of the TCR and
recruitment of the downstream kinase ZAP70.Rather, a longer bound time as
well as higher ligand density increases the receptor clustering, and it is
clusters of ligated receptors which robustly recruit ZAP70. Our study
reveals that bond lifetime is not ???read-out??? as a single molecule
event, but instead increases the probability of cluster formation. <br> GroEL unfolds the SH3 domain of PI3K by a thermodynamic coupling
mechanism </br><br>Chaperones arehelper proteins that can be visualized as
nano-machines that carry out the final step ofinformation transfer from
DNA to biologically active protein. GroEL-ES system is the most well
studied bacterial chaperone, which has homologues in eukaryotes as well.
GroEL helps in increasing both the rate and the yield of the protein
folding reaction. One of the proposed mechanisms of action of GroEL rests
on its ?unfolding? activity. GroEL has been shown to rescue proteins from
stably misfolded states by unfolding them, using the free energy of
binding and ATP hydrolysis. In this project, I have studied the unfolding
activity of GroEL using a model protein.
In this AWS, I?ll show that GroEL unfolds the PI3K SH3 domain under
conditions where the unfolded state is insignificantly populated. A stable
complex can be formed between SH3 domain and GroEL starting from the
native conformation of SH3 domain.GroEL unfolds the SH3 domain without
changing the microscopic rate of unfolding, indicating that it unfolds the
SH3 domain of PI3K by a thermodynamic coupling mechanism; coupling the
favorable free energy of binding to the unfavorable free energy of
unfolding under native conditions. GroEL also modulates the refolding
kinetics of SH3 domain. The refolding kinetics in the light of the
unfolding action will also be discussed. <br> The Effects of Origin of Replication on Chromosomal Architecture
and Gene Expression in E. coli </br><br>To survive in the wild, micro-organisms have to often out
grow their neighbors. For that, they need to reduce their division time.
To achieve this bacteria need to fine tune replication, transcription and
translation. Replication is at the center of this problem. Fast growing
bacteria, like E.coli which have a longer replication period than division
period, solve this problem by initiating replication more than once per
cell cycle. This creates a gene dosage gradient from the origin of
replication to the terminus of replication. It seems that fast growing
bacteria use this gene dosage gradient in their favour by arranging genes
whose products are required in high quantity, like the rRNA genes, close
to the origin of replication.
Another feature of the bacterial chromosome is its compaction and
segregation into physical domains. There also seems to be a connection
between the chromosome topology and gene expression, as this segregates
genes on the basis of their expression, like stress related genes are
present on the terminus macro-domain. Many chromosome structuring
proteins, e.g. H-NS, are directly involved in gene regulation.
Replication direction and gene regulation are also connected. It it seen
that majority of the genes in bacteria are present on the leading strand,
along the direction of replication to avoid head on collisions between the
replication fork and transcription bubble.
Here we ask, using E.coli, how important is this arrangement by perturbing
it and looking at the changes in the expression pattern, chromosome
topology and how will the organism adapt to this change. <br> Function of Protein Kinase D in regulating growth in Drosophila
melanogaster </br><br>Protein Kinase D is a Serine-Threonine Kinase belonging to
the subfamily of Calcium/Calmodulin Kinases. It is known to regulate a
wide variety of fundamental biological processes like signal transduction,
cell proliferation and differentiation, membrane trafficking. Three
isoforms of PKD are known in mammals but in Drosophila, there is a single
orthologue whose broad expression profile indicates to a more general role
in growth and development. Our results shows that PKD is required during
the growth stages of Drosophila as perturbing PKD function causes
reduction in size and weight of the animals. During the larval phase,
feeding coupled with secretion of Insulin like peptides results in
systemic growth. Most of the Insulin like peptides are produced from the
IPCs and fatbodies along with factors that regulate their secretion.
Disrupting PKD function in the fatbody and IPCs specifically, causes
impaired growth. To access precisely that PKD is affecting Insulin
mediated growth, we looked at the various manifestations of Impaired
Insulin signaling and TOR pathway like Trehalose and total lipid levels,
and phosphorylation of Akt and S6Kinase. Our results indicate that
decreasing PKD levels/function causes an impaired Insulin signaling either
by regulating the secretion of Insulin or factors that regulate Insulin
secretion during growth. <br> Evolutionary studies on insect odorant binding proteins. </br><br>Olfaction is an important phenomenon involved in several
insect processes like host-seeking, foraging for food, mate selection and
oviposition behavior. The sensillary lymph around dendrites abounds in
Odorant Binding Proteins (OBPs) in the millimolar range. Several odorants
and pheromones are able to directly activate olfactory receptors. While
the olfactory system in insects has been relatively well-studied, the role
of odorant binding proteins (OBPs) has not been clear. Previous work from
the lab (Manoharan et al, 2013) identified 110 new OBPs in the genomes of
the mosquito species- Anopheles gambiae, Aedes aegypti and Culex
quinquefasciatus. The previously standardized pipeline was re-examined.
Recently, the computational pipeline was modified and applied to the Apis
florea genome to search for Olfactory Receptors (Karpe et al., manuscript
in preparation). I have applied this modified pipeline to identify a total
of 23 OBPs in Apis florea. <br> Biochemical analysis of Phosphatidic acid (PA) signaling inDrosophila phototransduction </br><br><p>The photosensitive membranes of animal photoreceptors undergo<br />light dependent turnover with consequent changes in receptor composition<br />and cellular function. However the biochemical basis of this phenomenon is<br />not clear. We find that in the rhabdomeral photoreceptors of the<br />Drosophila compound eye, regulation of phosphatidic acid (PA) levels is<br />critical for photoreceptor structure and function. PA levels in<br />photoreceptors are regulated by multiple enzymes; however the importance<br />of PA generated by each of these is unknown.<br />One of these enzymes is Phospholipase-D (PLD) which hydrolyses<br />phosphatidylcholine (PC) to generate PA. In order to understand the<br />in-vivo function of this particular source of PA, our lab has generated<br />a loss of function mutant of PLD (dPLD3.1).dPLD3.1 shows light dependent<br />retinal degeneration. To understand the biochemical basis of this retinal<br />degeneration, I have studied the regulation of the PA modulated by each<br />enzymes using direct infusion mass spectrometry (Shotgun-MS). We find that<br />photoreceptors contain a light dependent PLD activity and restoring levels<br />of its product PA are sufficient to maintain apical membrane size during<br />illumination.</p> <br> Systematics of Indian butterflies: elucidating evolutionary patterns </br><br>Systematics is the study of diversification and
interrelationships among life forms. From the time of Linnaeus in late
1700s, approaches to systematics have continuously been updated. Since the
application of molecular techniques, endeavors in systematics have been
modified to include both morphological traits and genetic data. This
integrated approach empowers systematics to depict the underlying
evolutionary patterns at a greater resolution.
Butterflies, as a group of insects, show astounding diversity. Large
variations in phenotypic characters made them a model system to answer
several evolutionary questions. In India, the field of butterfly
systematics started in late 1800s and has been continued by several
eminent naturalists. These taxonomic studies relied on morphological
characters alone to distinguish species and subspecies. However, there are
groups of butterflies which cannot be well resolved only based on
morphological characters. Thus, an integrated approach (with morphological
and genetic data) is needed to delineate species more accurately and
elucidate diversification patterns in Indian butterflies.
As a first step, I will study a powerful morphological character, namely
variation in genitalia morphology. This character is a proxy of
reproductive isolation and has been used to delimit species in earlier
studies. In this AWS, I will talk about the variations in butterfly
genitalia morphology and some of the interesting patterns I observed.
Based on these patterns, I will also describe my future goals to explain
species diversification on the Indian landscape in a spatio-temporal
manner. Ultimately, I also hope to suggest modified strategies to use
morphological data in the framework of modern systematics. <br> The frequency of internal Shine-Dalgarno like sequences in prokaryotes </br><br>In prokaryotes, translation initiation typically depends on
complementary binding between a G-rich Shine-Dalgarno (SD) motif in the
5??? untranslated region of mRNAs, and the 3??? tail of the 16S ribosomal
RNA (the anti-SD sequence). In some cases, SD-like motifs in the coding
region generate ???programmed??? ribosomal pauses that are beneficial for
protein folding or accurate targeting. However, such pauses can also
reduce protein production, generating purifying selection against internal
SD-like motifs. Furthermore, this selection should be stronger in GC-rich
genomes that are more likely to harbour the G-rich SD motif. However, the
nature and consequences of selection acting on internal SD-like motifs
within genomes and across species remains unclear.
We analyzed the frequency of SD-like hexamers in the coding regions of 277
prokaryotes with known anti-SD sequences. After accounting for GC content,
we found that internal SD-like hexamers are avoided in 227 prokaryotes,
and in three of seven additional species that do not use the SD mechanism
to initiate translation. The degree of avoidance was higher in GC-rich
genomes, mesophiles, and N-terminal regions of genes. In contrast, 50
species either showed no signature of avoidance or were enriched in
internal SD-like motifs. C-terminal gene regions were also relatively
enriched in SD-like hexamers, such that they act as translation initiation
sites for the downstream gene. Together, our results suggest that the
frequency of internal SD-like hexamers is governed by multiple factors
including GC content and genome organization, and further empirical work
is necessary to understand the evolution and functional roles of these
motifs. <br> Using Genome-wide SNP data to explore population structure of
tigers in India </br><br>The past few centuries have witnessed large-scale species
extinction and decline, a period that many refer to as the ?anthropocene?.
Increased habitat loss and fragmentation are among the primary causes of
this biodiversity loss. Large carnivores are known to be particularly
vulnerable to extinction. Tigers are one such example. Once widely
distributed, they are now estimated to occupy a mere 7% of their
historical range. Nearly two thirds of the global tigers occur in the
Indian subcontinent. Securing the future of Indian tigers is hence
critical for the species? survival. Indian tigers are distributed across
many small protected areas across the country. Management and conservation
effort for tigers should however not be based on individual protected
areas only, as these might not reflect the extents of genetic
connectivity. In this study, we aim to identify the genetic units
underlying these protected areas.
We find that tigers cluster into four genetic units. One of the genetic
units identified (NW) is comprised of a single protected area. This
pattern corroborates the results from a previous study that found this
population to be isolated. However, our study identifies additional
genetic differentiation in peninsular India in contrast to the previous
study. This is perhaps due to increased resolution as a result of using
SNP markers. We also examined genetic diversity within these genetic
clusters.We find that overall, most diversity is shared across all
clusters and very little is private to each genetic cluster. This is
perhaps because of their very recent shared ancestry. However, the
isolated cluster has lower genetic diversity. Our study therefore
highlights the need to focus conservation efforts on the isolated
population, perhaps by facilitating connectivity with other populations. <br> Neural basis of development of coordinated walking in Drosophila </br><br>Many animals start to walk in a coordinated fashion as soon as
they are born. But without any real world experience, how this complex
behavior is established is not known. It is often speculated that limb
movements prior to birth could help in formation and refining of the
locomotor circuit. We investigated this using Drosophila pupa as the model
system.
Drosophila starts walking as soon as it is born. We looked at the leg
movements before the fly is born. Results show that, pre eclosion, legs in
a wild type Drosophila pupa twitch in periodic bursts. We, then tried to
understand the role of motor and sensory neurons in patterning the leg
activity in pupa and shaping the adult walking behavior. We found that
loss of motor neuron activity stops the episodic bursting activity of
pupal legs, but walking behavior is not affected. The periodic bursting
activity is also lost as soon as the sensory neuron activity is inhibited.
But as the animal develop, the periodic bursting activity is restored
despite the loss of sensory feedback. Though, animals deprived of sensory
feedback during development fail to walk properly. Thus, the data suggest
that patterned leg activity during development is not only a result of the
fore lying neural activity but also dependent on the sensory feedback; and
sensory feedback is an important factor for proper locomotor function
development. <br> BRIDGING THE GAP : From electrical to chemical synapses </br><br>Reliable and stereotypic neuronal connectivity is crucial for an
organism to behave properly. This depends on neurons forming electrical
synapses (gap junctions) and/or chemical synapses between them at the
appropriate time and location. It has been observed in various studies in
rats and leeches that gap junctions are abundant in the CNS during early
stages of development, and are gradually reduced in number, temporally
accompanied by increase in chemical synapses. Manipulation in levels of
electrical synapses has been seen to affect chemical synapse numbers.
This suggests that gap junctions pave way for chemical synapse formation.
Zebrafish has various genes encoding gap junctions. One gene of particular
interest is the Connexin -35 (Cx35) because of its widespread presence in
the central nervous system of zebrafish larvae(Jabeen, S., & Thirumalai,
V. (2013) Frontiers in Neural Circuits). Chemical synapses on the other
hand have various components. I have chosen to focus on PSD-95, since it
is associated with all glutamatergic synapses and will serve as a good
proxy for their localisation. Miniature excitatory post synaptic currents
(mEPSCs) recorded in Purkinjeneurons of control and Cx -35 knocked down
larvae show a decreased frequency in the latter, but with no change in the
amplitude of the currents, as compared to the control group. This led
me to ask whether Cx35 encoded gap junctions guide the formation of
chemical synapses . I plan to answer this question by live imaging of
electrical and chemical synapses in the Purkinje neurons of zebrafish
larvae to see if there is a correlation in the dynamics of the two.
In this AWS, I will be showing results of various techniques I have tried
to introduce plasmids to visualize the neuron and Cx35 gap junctions.
Also, I will show results of time lapse imaging of zebrafish Purkinje
neurons and quantification of their growth so as to estimate the best time
frame to image the dynamics of the electrical and chemical synapses. <br> Regulation of cell size by phosphoinositides in Drosophila
melanogaster </br><br>Phosphatidylinositol is a glycerophospholipid that can be
phosphorylated at position 3, 4, or 5 of the inositol ring, to generate a
set of molecules with multiple activity in biological systems.
Phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate(PI5P) is one of these phosphoinositides
which have been implicated in various signalling pathways. Although this,
PI5P?s function in cells remains unclear. It has been shown from work done
in our lab, that
phosphatidylinositol 5 phosphate 4 kinase (dPIP4K) mutant in Drosophila
show elevated levels of PI5P and a reduction in cell size (Gupta et al.,
2013). This provides us a model to study if PI5P can regulate cell size.
In this AWS, I will discuss work ongoing in this regard where I will
compare cell size phenotypes obtained by manipulating genes that can
putatively regulate levels of PI5P in Drosophila.

It has one of the 10 most common protein folds, ?beta grasp fold?, where the sole helix is packed against beta sheet consisting of 5 beta strands. The thermodynamics and kinetics of (un)folding of MNEI has been extensively characterized in the past decade. However, there is very little information on the structural mechanism of folding of MNEI so far. In this study we are investigating the sequence of structural events accompanying the folding of MNEI by using Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer as the major methodology. For this purpose, I have designed, synthesized and characterized various tryptophan mutants of MNEI to get FRET pair spanning different structural parts (such as helix, beta sheet, etc) of the protein. In this AWS, I shall be discussing some interesting observations made with these rationally designed FRET pair mutants. We have also custom built a setup for simultaneously measuring steady state and time resolved fluorescence to monitor the kinetics of folding in the millisecond time domain. Preliminary data suggest that packing of alpha helix against beta sheet involves both cooperative and diffusive changes probed by putting a FRET pair across helix ? beta sheet interface.</p> <br> Plasticity in the antennal and central clock of honey bee foragers </br><br><p>One of the major functions of the circadian clock is to adjust behavior timing to predictable diurnal changes in environmental conditions, i.e. day and night, temperature, food availability etc. In addition there are multiple lines of evidence that the circadian clock not only regulates the behavior, but also various physiological processes involved in those behaviors. For e.g. mating in many insectsoccurs at a specific time of the day and during that time sex pheromone secretion and sensitivity of sex-pheromone specific olfactory sensory neurons are higher. Originally, I was interested in studying gene expression changes in male honey bee antennae co-occurring with mating flights. Thus, in a first attempt, I studied daily expression changes of clock genes and candidate genes involved in neuromodulation.Later, I extended my studies on daily gene expression changes in honey bee foragers antennae with respect to peak foraging hours. In an enclosed outdoor flight chamber honeybee colonies and their foragers can be exposed to different feeding regimes. In my experiments, I compared expression patterns of circadian clock genes in the antennae and brains of foragers that were allowed to forage at a feeder over the whole day or were only allowed to forage at a feeder for 1-2 hours in the morning or the evening. My current results indicate that restricted feeding regime shifts the expression pattern of clock genes suggesting that feeding or foraging activity is capable of entraining the central clock in honey bees.</p>
 <br> Acto-myosin driven membrane dynamics drive local membrane
component organization in an in vitro active composite layer </br><br>The surface of a living cell provides a platform for receptor
signaling, protein sorting, transport and endocytosis, whose regulation
requires the local control of membrane organization. Previous work has
revealed a role for dynamic acto-myosin in membrane protein and lipid
organization, suggesting that the cell surface behaves as an active
composite composed of a fluid bilayer and a thin-film of active
acto-myosin. We reconstitute an analogous system in vitro that consists of
a fluid lipid bilayer coupled via membrane-associated actin binding
proteins to dynamic actin filaments and myosin motors. Regeneration of ATP
supports a constitutively remodeling acto-myosin state which in turn
drives active fluctuations of coupled membrane components, resembling
those observed at the cell surface. In a multicomponent membrane bilayer,
this remodeling acto-myosin layer contributes to changes in the extent and
dynamics of phase segregating domains. These first results indicate how
this complex reconstituted system can be used to test theoretical models
and how local membrane composition can be driven by active processes
arising from acto-myosin highlighting the fundamental basis of the active
composite model of the cell surface and indicate its relevance to the
study of membrane organization. <br> Altered dynamics of mouse prion protein during salt induced oligomerization </br><br><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Proper folded structure of a protein is crucial to carry its biological function(s) and hence maintain living systems. It is well known that several proteins upon misfolding cause fatal diseases. Prion is one such protein which upon aggregation causes fatal neurodegenerative diseases like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Fatal Familial Insomnia (FFI), Kuru etc. which have no cure. In order to discover therapeutic targets it is important to study how the conversion of the monomeric protein to oligomer(s) happens. The mouse prion protein (moPrP) is &alpha;-helical at pH 4 in absence of salt. Upon addition of 150mM NaCl at pH and 37oC it oligomerizes to a &beta;-sheet rich structure.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&nbsp;have studied the effect of salt and temperature variations on the native (monomeric) structure by solution Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. These results suggest that NaCl binds weakly to moPrP, resulting in loss of vital interactions destabilizing the protein. Also the unstructured N-terminus of the protein shows increased conformational flexibility upon addition of salt.</p> <br> Phospholipase D regulates turnover of photosensitive membrane inDrosophila photoreceptors </br><br><p>The plasma membrane of cells undergoes continuous turnover<br />with consequent changes in receptor composition and cellular function. A<br />balance of endocytosis and the delivery of new membrane are key factors<br />for maintaining membrane homeostasis, yet the coupling between these<br />events remains unclear.<br />The light sensitive apical plasma membrane of Drosophila photoreceptors<br />(rhabdomere) undergoes turnover during illumination with changes in<br />rhabdomere size.The change in rhabdomere volume is accompanied by changes<br />in the level and localization of apical membrane protein rhodopsin 1.<br />We also find that photoreceptors contain a light activated phospholipase D<br />(dPLD) activity. During illumination, lack of PLD is associated with<br />collapse of the rhabdomere and the accumulation of rhodopsin containing<br />membranes in the cell body. Apical membrane collapse in photoreceptors<br />lacking dPLD was suppressedby increasing recycling. In this AWS I will<br />present evidence which suggest during illumination,dPLD is a key regulator<br />of membrane turnover by aiding recycling of rhodopsin containing membrane<br />to the plasma membrane.</p> <br> Extended Particles in an Active Polar Fluid </br><br>The cortex of eukaryotic cells is a thin film of actin
filaments, myosin motors and related proteins that is driven strongly out
of equilibrium by the consumption of ATP. The generation of stresses and
flows at the microscopic level leads to novel collective behaviour. We
construct a minimal coarse-grained theory of actin filaments and myosin
motors and find that they self-assemble into compact, particle-like
objects that can be either mobile or static. In this AWS I will describe
results on their form, dynamics and the interactions that emerge between
them. I will also describe an effective theory of these structures, and
indicate how we may now probe the role of actomyosin in the spatiotemporal
regulation of cell surface organisation. <br> Tipping the scales on calcium balance in dopaminergic neurons: a
GPCR perspective </br><br>Calcium is synonymous with a wide variety of cellular
processes such as gene transcription, signal transduction, neural
excitability etc., which could all potentially impact animal behaviour.
Two key molecules of interest in Ca2+ signaling are the endoplasmic
reticulum resident Ca2+ channel, namely, inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate
receptor (IP3R) and the ER calcium store depletion sensor, namely,
stromal-interacting molecule (STIM). A number of extracellular stimuli
that activate GPCRs can lead to the rapid release of Ca2+ from ER stores,
via the IP3R. Subsequently, store depletion is sensed by STIM, which then
oligomerize and appose against the ER-PM junctions to facilitate ORAI
channel formation. It is through these channels that Ca2+ from the
extracellular milieu enters the cytoplasm, a process known as
store-operated calcium entry, SOCE. In Drosophila, mutants of IP3R show
wing posture and flight defects. These phenotypes are recapitulated upon
pan neuronal down regulation of IP3R or STIM, demonstrating a neuronal
requirement of these genes for this phenotype. More specifically, work is
the lab has shown that reduced SOCE in dopaminergic neurons results in
flight deficits.
Alternatively, pushing the SOCE balance to the other end of the scale,
i.e., increasing SOCE in dopaminergic neurons by over expression of
molecules involved in this pathway also leads to reduced flight. The most
striking effect on flight appears with a neuropeptide GPCR, FMRFaR which
is enriched in dopaminergic neurons and functions upstream of IP3R. Over
expression of FMRFaR in dopaminergic neurons leads to complete loss of
flight. In this AWS, I will be presenting work that demonstrates that the
Drosophila flight circuit requires a critical balance of SOCE to function
effectively. I will also share some experiments used to probe the
mechanism behind these phenotypes. <br> Non-lethal effects of predator-prey interactions: A behavioural
perspective </br><br>Predation is a strong selective force in the wild that
impacts prey populations and ecosystems. For animals commonly falling prey
to predators, anti-predatory responses help enhance their survivorship.
Detecting predators and associated levels of threat is crucial for prey to
respond appropriately. Aquatic organisms, on sensing predators, respond
behaviourally by altering movement patterns, seeking refuge and spend
lesser time in high risk activities like foraging, seeking mates, etc.
While engaging in low-risk behaviours is assumed to be costly for prey,
the magnitude of anti-predatory responses is expected to vary with the
ability of prey to cope up with such costs. Also, studies investigating
predator-prey interactions often assume a survival benefit with any
observed change in behaviour but testing the same experimentally might not
be feasible always.
In my talk, I will be discussing results from:
1. Experiments focussing on the behaviour of larvae and pupae of Asian
tiger mosquito, Aedes aegypti in response to predation threat from guppy
fishes, Poecilia reticulata.
2. Experiments investigating the survival benefit and costs associated
with the observed prey responses to predation threat.
Using these results, I intend to demonstrate how varying ecological
contexts drive adaptive flexibility in prey responses to threat from
predators. <br> Genetic and functional characterization of a small colony variantemerging during prolonged stationary phase. </br><br><p>Bacteria are subjected to long and short term stresses in different forms throughout their life. In my work, I have studied a small colony variant(SCV) of Escherichia coli. Which emerged during prolonged stationary phase. E.coli has been known to form small colonies under the effect of a plethora of stresses. They are mostly isolated from clinical isolates as of yet. Two facts which were established regarding small colony variants were- 1. They show a slow growth phenotype (Colwell, 1946; Clowes and Rowley, 1955) 2. They have increased resistance towards a host of stress factors like antibiotics, oxidative stress.(Proctor 2006, Hiendler 2006 and others)Here we focus to find the mutations contributing to the small colony variant phenotype from resequencing data, and look whether this SCV is similiar to the previously reported variants in terms of resistance profile. In my second line of work, I look at bacterial evolution under different stresses relevant in pathogenesis, starting with pH stress.</p>
 <br> Cellular and molecular heterogeneity of fibroblasts in fibrosis ?
eliciting distinct fibroblast responses from the same extracellular cue. </br><br>. Fibrosis is overproduction of extracellular matrix (ECM) that
leads to tissue hardening and loss of organ function. All organs are prone
to develop fibrosis following an injury or an injury like response and
fibrosis can be thought of as an overhealing wound. Fibrosis can be either
cause or consequence of chronic and fatal conditions like - scleroderma,
liver cirrhosis, COPD, myocardial infraction, diabetic nephropathy and
even solid tumours. The common link between all fibrotic conditions and
even wound healing is activation of a fibroblast which involves fibroblast
migration, proliferation and its differentiation into a myofibroblast
under a given set of cues. The myofibroblasts then chronically secrete
excessive ECM leading to fibrosis. However, this raises an interesting
puzzle of whether the same fibroblast performs all of the processes that
fall under the umbrella term of ?activation? or are there sub-populations
of fibroblasts performing specific functions despite receiving the same
extracellular cue. Given the same extracellular cue, the question that
follows is at what signalling level the cell decides to perform a certain
function over the other. Using Snail transgenic mouse as a model for skin
fibrosis I have discovered an extracellular signalling molecule ? Mindin,
which causes both fibroblast migration and their differentiation to
myofibroblast. We find that not only does Mindin have different effect on
two major population of fibroblasts in skin but also that how it uses the
same closely related Src Family Kinases (SFKs) members to mediate these
two different functions. In the future this work will lead to
understanding that if there is a difference in signalling within different
fibroblast subpopulations and how it contributes to fibrosis. <br> Beyond the Amygdala: Region-specific Diversity of the Effects of
Stress in the Rat Brain </br><br>Stress has a debilitating effect on our body and is the
leading cause behind multiple physiological and psychological disorders.
Using rodent models to study the effects of stress on the brain, previous
studies from our lab have largely focused on the amygdala, which shows an
increase in structural and functional plasticity due to stress. Moving
beyond the amygdala, therefore, I have looked at how stress affects two
other brain regions ??? hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex, using an
immobilisation stress model in rats. I have also investigated the
hypothesis of a possible role of the amygdala in regulating the effects of
stress at these regions. I shall be summarising the initial results
obtained, which might give us an insight into the fundamental effects of
stress across spatially separated brain regions. <br> Understanding the Mechanism behind Initiation and Maintenance of
the Wound-Healing Response </br><br>The wound-healing program is a complex biological process,
where effective communications between numerous cell types are necessary.
In spite of decades of research on wound-healing, basic questions such as;
?how do cells sense the injury? and ?what are the downstream
wound-response pathways? remain elusive. We previously found that
downregulation of caspase-8 is a physiological response to cutaneous
injury. We also showed that epidermal knock out of caspase-8 is
sufficient to initiate a signalling cascade that mimics the wound healing
response in the absence of any tissue damage. The significance of
caspase-8 downregulation could be understood by the fact that failure in
this process leads to perturbed wound-healing, as observed
in diabetic mouse wounds. These results also uncovered a non-apoptotic
role for caspase-8 and suggest that the loss of this protein can fuel many
processes that are critical for initiating wound-healing response. Our
observations led us to inquire about the mechanisms inducing the
wound-response, using caspase-8 downregulation as a cellular reporter of
this phenomenon. My results so far suggest that cells can sense the change
in intercellular mechanical forces as an important early wound signals. 
Using in vivo and in vitro model systems, I also found that de-novo DNA
methyltransferase (DNMT3a) plays a critical role in the dynamic regulation
of caspase-8 promoter
methylation during tissue repair. My observations are consistent with the
reports showing elevated DNMT activity leading to caspase-8 downregulation
in various carcinomas. Overall my results suggest that changes in
intercellular mechanical forces govern the methylation status of caspase-8
by regulating DNMT3a localisation. <br> Bacterial Community dynamics across developmental stages of
butterflies </br><br>Recent work indicates that microbial communities of insects
play a major role in determining resource use by aiding digestion of
complex nutrients or toxins, synthesizing nutrients that are absent in the
diet, or by preventing infections. Studies have shown that with different
dietary habits across insect species, gut microbial community structure
differs. Interestingly, dietary switching is also observed within the 
lifetime of holometabolous insects (insects which undergo complete 
metamorphosis during development);butterflies are an excellent 
example of this. They not only show distinct dietary habits across
different species but also during different developmental stages of an
individual. Butterflies undergo complete metamorphosis and show four
distinct stages of development ? egg, larva, pupa and adult. Generally, 
larvae of most butterfly species feed on plant foliage but some 
species from the family Lycaenidae exclusively feed on insect prey
 such as mealybugs, ant larvae, scale insects or aphids. Adult
butterflies solely feed on a liquid diet and depending upon the species,
it could range from plant sap/nectar to fluid component of decaying matter
and dung. It is unclear whether and how these extreme dietary switches
during development affect the insect?s gut microbes and whether the 
gut bacterial community in turn facilitates the diet switch. To
address this, we propose to analyse the gut microbial communities of
butterflies across developmental stages. We have analysed 8 butterfly
species for the bacterial community dynamics across developmental stages.
In this AWS, I will summarize the results for the same. <br> Biophysical characterization of two different types of
co-existing alpha-synuclein fibrils and their tuning by Thioflavin-T </br><br>Transition of natively unfolded alpha-synuclein monomers to
beta-sheet rich oligomers and fibrils is associated with various
neurodegenerative diseases. Various phenotypes in disease is associated
with different type of aggregates made of the same protein shows the
existence of different strains/polymorphs. These polymorphs exhibit
different physical and chemical properties and show different cytotoxic
effects. In-vitro solution conditions determine the process of aggregation
and the extent of polymorphism. Here, we use a molecule Thioflavin-T (ThT)
to test how it affects the aggregation process of alpha-synuclein. ThT is
a cationic dye that shows different fluorescence properties upon binding
to fibrils and widely use to monitor the aggregation kinetics. Here, we
found that ThT enhances the aggregation rate of alpha-synuclein by binding
to the
aggregates and it stabilizes the one type of fibrils/polymorph and reduces
the extent of fibrils polymorphism. <br> Spike timing precision and reliability for WT vs FMR1 KO mouse models </br><br>Studies done for cortical networks,hippocampal slices and
cultures have put forward the idea of ?reliability? and ?precision? in
spikes produced by a neuron, for repeated trials of same current stimuli.
It?s a published result that the reliability and precision of producing
spikes by a neuron is higher in a noisy stimulus and these parameters drop
in the presence of an excitable network and in altered functioning of some
channels. Fragile X disease is associated with increased network
excitability and malfunctioning of many ion channels. It would be
interesting to see a direct outcome of the abnormalities because of the
disease in the form of physiology experiments. Preliminary results show
that increase in noise leads to increased reliability and precision,
though the results are not statistically significant. I am currently
looking the ?reliability? and ?precision? parameters under different noise
conditions and plan to further narrow it down to the action of specific
ion channels, especially those affected in Fragile X. <br> Communities as ensembles: toy models of metabolism in microbial
populations </br><br>Life in communities is observed at many scales. As a common
motif in evolution, being in a community generally confers an advantage to
its members through shared resources and protecting against foreign
attacks. However, studying communities experimentally as ecosystems is
hard, especially when we don't know what to look for. We present attempts
at building a toy model of microbial communities that has some features of
ecosystems. We try and zoom out and coarse-grain these systems into a
couple of numbers, and see if such a model can capture something about
metabolism or populations. <br> Mapping and analysis of heterogeneous precursors in Drosophila
lymph gland hematopoiesis </br><br>Mature blood cells arise by the proliferation and
differentiation of multipotent, self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells
(HSCs). Vertebrate HSCs differ in their self-renewal capacities and
developmental potential and are classified as quiescent long term HSCs
(LT-HSCs) and actively proliferating short term HSCs (ST-HSCs). This
heterogeneous pool is tightly regulated by multiple signaling pathways to
maintain homeostasis. Drosophila hematopoiesis has served as a good model
for hematopoiesis due to well-conserved molecular mechanisms. However, the
heterogeneity of HSCs has not been investigated in detail. The Drosophila
lymph gland is a multi-lobed structure and the primary site of larval
hematopoiesis. The cellular composition and molecular signals that
regulate HSCs in the primary lobe have been studied extensively. However,
the posterior lobes, with their abundant pool of progenitors, have not
been explored sufficiently. We map distinct, geographically limited
regions of gene expression within the lymph gland posterior lobes.
Further, with the help of mutant analysis and genetic perturbation studies
we are identifying local and systemic signals that affect prohemocyte
maintenance and posterior lobe dispersal during metamorphosis. We find
that posterior lobes do not undergo terminal differentiation during pupal
stages. In contrast to primary lobes, posterior lobe hemocytes are
mitotically active in the third larval instar. We are addressing molecular
mechanisms that maintain quiescence and HSC maintenance. <br> Analysis of deficits in social behavior in a novel rat model of
Fragile X syndrome. </br><br>Traditionally studies on autism using animal model systems have
looked at learning disability, partly restricted by the simplicity of
tasks that can be executed by the model and partly due to historically
interests being nurtured in tasks that look at learning disability. As
such, the social angle remains relatively under-explored. The social
aspect becomes an important area to look at because of the strong
correlation with social deficits in Autistic patients. With a new rat
model of Fragile-X syndrome, having a knockout of the Fmr1 gene, I
performed the traditional Social Interaction task in an Open Field Arena.
Along with that, I will also be presenting preliminary data from a new
behavior paradigm: A T-maze choice interaction task that takes a fresh
look at the social interaction story. <br> Sequence and structural analysis of RNA-binding proteins </br><br>RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) stabilise, protect, package or
transport RNA, mediate RNA interactions with other macromolecules or act
catalytically on RNA (cutting, unwinding, modifying, replicating etc.).
Hence, precise molecular recognition between RNA elements and protein
residues or protein scaffolds is crucial. RNA-protein interactions, though
functionally important, have been less understood as compared to the very
well-studied DNA-protein interactions. This is reflected by the number of
structures present in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) for the two nucleic
acid-protein complexes ? 1726 RNA-protein complexes as compared to 3519
DNA-protein complexes, as of April 2016.
We have organised information of RBPs, curated as mathematical models, and
performed a comprehensive computational study of the human proteome that
relies on sequence search algorithms to identify proteins that are likely
to interact directly with RNA. The stringent distance cut-off criteria and
protein sequence and/or structure signatures in the searches have led to
more than 2600 gene products with RBP signatures to be identified in
humans. We have also used a similar search strategy to compare and
contrast the RBPomes of pathogenic and non-pathogenic E. coli strains. We
are currently looking into proteins that are exclusively present in the
pathogenic strains.
We have also developed a webserver, RStrucFam, which to the best of our
knowledge is the first of its kind that exploits structurally conserved
features, derived from known family members and imprinted in mathematical
models, to predict the structure, type of cognate RNA(s) of proteins, from
mere sequence information.

bisphosphate at the plasma membrane </br><br>Phosphatidylinositol 4,5- bisphosphate (PIP2) is a minor
class of signaling lipid primarily found on the inner leaflet of plasma
membranes. It can regulate a wide array of subcellular functions in this
location simultaneously. PIP2 can directly bind to downstream effector
proteins leading to regulation of functions such as endocytosis and
maintenance of cytoskeleton. Else, it can be hydrolyzed by enzymes such as
phospholipase C leading to the production of second messengers such as IP3
and DAG. It has been proposed that functionally distinct pools of PIP2
underlie the ability of a single molecule to regulate such diverse
functions with high fidelity at the plasma membrane. The mechanism by
which such pools might be generated and maintained remains disputed.
Work done in our lab has shown that functional pools of PIP2 generated by
distinct lipid kinases exist on the plasma membranes of Drosophila
photoreceptors. The gene dPIP5K encodes a lipid kinase that produces a
PLC sensitive pool of PIP2 involved in photo transduction whereas another
lipid kinase encoded by skittles is required to generate PIP2 required
for housekeeping functions. The dPIP5K gene is spliced to generate
multiple splice forms with a conserved lipid kinase domain and a variable
C-terminus. We hypothesize that the variable C terminus regions of these
dPIP5K variants mediate specific interactions with effector proteins
leading to localized, context dependent production of PIP2 .
To address this hypothesis I am investigating the functions of
photoreceptor enriched splice form of dPIP5K. In this AWS, I will provide
evidence for the existence of an eye-enriched splice variant of dPIP5K. I
will also describe my plans to functionally characterize this splice form
and uncover its roles in generating distinct pools of PIP2 in the plasma
membrane. <br> The significance of multi-domain phosphatidylinositol transfer
proteins (PITPs) in vivo </br><br>Phosphatidylinositol (PI) is a glycerophospholipid synthesized
in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). PI serves as the biochemical precursor
for the synthesis of its phosphorylated derivatives collectively termed as
phosphoinositides (PPIs) which have multiple functions in cells. Although
PI is synthesized in the ER, most PPIs are formed on the membranes of
organelles distinct from the ER. Hence PI needs to be trafficked from the
ER to various organelles for the synthesis of PPIs by lipid kinases. A
well-studied mechanism of such transport is through the action of PI
transfer proteins (PITPs). While there are numerous studies on the in
vitro properties of PITPs, relatively few studies on in vivo function
exist. Further, most studies have focused on Class I PITPs whereas the
multidomain Class II PITPs remain largely unexplored.
To understand the biological function of Class II PITPs, I study
Drosophila photoreceptors that express a Class II PITP encoded by rdgB.
Loss of rdgB function leads to defects in electrical response to light and
also light-dependent degeneration of photoreceptors. Previous work has
shown that reconstitution with the PITP domain alone is sufficient to
rescue some but not all phenotypes of rdgB. This observation suggests that
the non-PITP domains of rdgB may contribute to its function in vivo. In
this AWS, I will describe my work attempting to understand the function of
one of these domains, the C-terminal LNS2 domain of RDGB. <br> MEMORY IN INSECT IMMUNITY- VARIATION, SELECTION AND FITNESS
CONSTRAINTS IN NATURAL POPULATIONS </br><br>Low doses of pathogens may prime the immune response in
insects and confer protection against a subsequent immune challenge later
in life. However, our understanding of the evolutionary and ecological
history of insect immune priming is far from complete. For instance, it is
still unclear whether the occurrence and strength of immune priming varies
across natural populations experiencing different ecological conditions,
and what are the selective pressures responsible for such variation. We
used 10 natural populations of beetle Tribolium castaneum to estimate the
variation in immune priming response against their natural pathogen
Bacillus thuringiensis. Simultaneously, we also measured their
antibacterial activity and susceptibility to infection to test if
populations with weaker immune function and higher post-infection
mortality mount stronger immune priming. Finally, we tested whether
variable fitness costs of immune priming explain the observed variation in
immune priming. Our results show large variation in immune priming
response across populations. We find support for the hypothesis that the
immune priming evolves in response to selection pressures imposed by
pathogens- fitness benefit of immune priming increases with the severity
of infection, with more susceptible populations mounting stronger immune
priming. Also, populations that have weaker immune function show greater
benefit of priming. Intriguingly, in most populations, priming confers an
immediate reproductive fitness benefit after infection, underscoring the
adaptive role of immune priming. However, such reproductive benefits limit
the post-infection survival benefits of priming. Overall, our results
indicate the fitness consequences and selective pressures that may govern
variation in immune priming in natural insect populations. <br> Activation of STIM1 protein, a mechanistic approach </br><br><p>Every cell is encompassed by a non-polar plasma membrane (PM). The selectively permeable plasma membrane harbours various proteins which function as portals for conducting polar molecules and/or signals across. This capability of transmembrane proteins immediately points to their existence in at least 2 states ? on and off. These states and their dynamics have been studied in detail for some PM proteins. However, in Eukaryotic cells, another level of similar complexity exists in the form of membrane-bound organelles. Due to multiple reasons, technical and otherwise, the switching transitions of protein on these endomembranes have generally remained unheeded. STIM1 is one such protein, resident in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) membrane. It regulates cellular calcium signalling by maintaining the ER calcium store. In the 11 years of its discovery, a lot of information has been generated due to its central importance in calcium homeostasis. But, understanding about its transition from an inactive to an active state remains obscure. In this AWS, I will discuss my efforts to address this question and the preliminary work done.</p> <br> Investigating Notch signalling and the regulation of mitochondrial
Ca2+ homeostasis </br><br>Notch signalling is evolutionary conserved across eukaryotes
and controls various fundamental processes such as differentiation,
growth, migration and apoptosis. Mitochondria lie in the core of the
cellular machinery, which provide energy for cellular functions, regulate
apoptosis and help cells to adapt to changing extracellular environments.
Previous work from the laboratory has shown that Notch1 activity protects
cells from mitochondrial damage and cell death triggered by stimuli that
activate apoptotic cascades. However, the mechanism[s] underlying this
outcome is not known. Mitochondrial function is sensitive to Ca2+and,in
turn, the organelle can modify the spatio-temporal distribution of Ca2+ in
cells.Thus, we have asked if Notch modulates mitochondrial calcium
homeostasis to protect from cell death. I will present data to show that
the molecular machinery that controls calcium uptake in mitochondria is
critical for Notch mediated anti-apoptotic activity. I will present
results of measuring free Ca2+ in mitochondria and ER using organelle
specific probes and modulation by Notch activity. Taken together, the
experiments suggest that changes in calcium homeostasis undelie Notch
mediated anti-apopotic functions. I will also present experiments, which
indicate that Notch1 activity differs from Bcl-xL, a member of theBcl-2
family, in protecting cells from apopotic damage. <br> Regulation of Drosophila larval growth and cell size by the lipid
kinase dPIP4K: </br><br>Phosphoinositides are important signaling molecules that regulate
multiple cellular functions. These are regulated by phosphatases and
kinases that monitor the levels within the cell. Phosphatidylinositol
5-hosphate 4-kinase (PIP4K) is one such enzyme that catalyzes the addition
of phosphate molecule at 4 position to the substrate PI5P to generate
PI(4,5)P2. PI5P is the lesser abundant lipid species that contributes to
the production of PI(4,5)P2 as compared to PI4P. It is important to
understand the role of PI(4,5)P2 generated by the unconventional means.
Loss-of-function mutants of dPIP4K in Drosophila are homozygous viable but
show delay in larval development and reduced body weight. This growth
defect is underpinned by a reduction in cell size but not cell number. The
reduction in cell size is associated with a reduction in the molecular
output of the TOR complex although the mechanism underlying this is
unclear. Studies are being carried out to understand the various signaling
pathways that feed in signals to TOR complex and where in this large
network is the function of dPIP4K required for regulation of cell size.

prolonged stationary-phase in E.coli </br><br>Microbes in the fluctuating environments evolve both
physiological as well as genetic strategies to thrive. One of the ways to
achieve it quickly and widely is to tinker with the activity of regulatory
genes that control a large set of genes.
E. coli culture frequently selects mutation in rpoS gene, a master
regulator facilitating transition from exponential to stationary-phase and
survival therein, in the early period of prolonged stationary-phase. One
such naturally selected allele of rpoS is RpoS819 resulting in a
suboptimally functional longer RpoS that confers higher fitness to the
E.coli in the stationary phase. Another round in prolonged
stationary-phase of E. coli with rpoS819 selects a mutation in hns gene, a
repressor, that results in longer H-NS with reduced function. Exploiting
the naturally selected altered alleles of hns and rpoS, I am addressing
the following questions:
1) What are the trade-offs in gene-expression in respective regulons of
the modified regulators? System level gene-expression is measured in
strains with modified alleles of rpoS and hns, alone as well as in
combination with their wild-type and null alleles using RNAsequencing.
2)What is the nature of constraints that the modified regulators are
exposed (stability, interaction with other partners )? To address this,
experimental evolution and whole genome sequencing is used to analyse the
spectrum of compensatory mutations accumulating in E. coli in the
background of rpoS819.
The focus of the presentation will be on the results from the evolution
experiment carried out to address the second question. <br> Microbes alter the fitness of the generalist flour beetle
Tribolium castaneum </br><br>Microbial interactions with their hosts can dramatically
influence the host?s adaptation to its environment. For example, several
insect species rely on their symbionts for essential amino acids,
digestive enzymes or detoxification of dietary toxins. For a given
environment therefore, these advantages can result in stable partnerships
between the host and the microbes, with co-evolution over the course of
several generations strengthening the partnership. If so, removal of
microbes would potentially have a larger effect on host fitness in this
ancestral environment, as opposed to a novel environment, where the
partnership is not expected to be strong.
We tested this possibility using an outbred population of red flour
beetle, (Tribolium castaneum), which is a generalist pest known to utilize
multiple resources. We measured the change in fitness observed by killing
microbes in both the beetle?s ancestral environment (Wheat) and a novel
environment (Jowar). We find that indeed killing microbes has a larger
fitness difference in the ancestral environment (Wheat), as opposed to a
novel environment. Overall, our results suggest that microbial partners
and their co-evolution with the host may alter the host?s fitness
dramatically and therefore have implications on the host?s adaptation to
its environment. <br> Structural mechanism utilized by the NS3-NS5 complex of Japanese
Encephalitis Virus to replicate the viral genome. </br><br>Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a neurotropic virus and
is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in the world. JEV belongs to
genus Flavivirus and the genome is composed of a single stranded positive
sense RNA molecule. The genome of JEV is about 11kb long with a 5?cap
(m7G5?ppp5?A) and no polyA tail at 3? end. The virally-encoded NS3 and NS5
proteins are centrally involved in the replication of viral genome. The
NS3 houses a protease activity in the N- terminal region and a RNA
helicase activity in the C-terminal part. NS5 possesses a
methyltransferase activity and a RNA-dependent-RNA Polymerase activity in
the N- and C-terminal regions, respectively. The NS3 and NS5 proteins
associate to form a complex that may represent the minimal replisome and
serves to generate multiple copies of the progeny genome. Using
structural, biochemical and biophysical tools I aim to discern how the
multiple enzyme activities in the minimal replisome are coordinated to
synthesize copies of the viral genome. The progress made towards this end
will be presented. <br> The role of PAI-1 in fibrogenesis </br><br>Fibrosis is a pathological condition, which forms a common link
between cancer, autoimmune disorders like scleroderma, myocardial
infarction and other diseases, that involve the connective tissue. Caused
by the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix components, it
involves activation of fibroblasts via different pathways. One of these
pathways reqires an immune cell type known as mast cells. Although the
mast cell-fibroblast connection has long been studied, the mechanisms
which regulate this interaction and subsequent fibroblast activation, are
still unanswered questions in the field. Using a mouse model of fibrosis,
where the transcription factor Snail is upregulated in the epidermal skin
layer, I will attempt to elucidate these mechanisms. I will be describing
how a factor, the Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1), secreted
from these epidermal cells leads to increased mast cell infiltration and
their adhesion to fibroblasts in the dermis. I will also address how this
attachment leads to fibroblast activation by upregulation of alpha-Smooth
Muscle Actin. Finally, I will talk about our hypothetical model, for this
mast cell mediated fibroblast activation. <br> Structural and Biochemical characterization of MsDpo4 from
Mycobacterium smegmatis </br><br>Members of the Y-family of DNA polymerases (dPols) are
critical for the rescue of the replication stalled at damaged nucleotides.
In addition, prokaryotic members of this family have been shown to
participate in the stress induced mutagenesis to facilitate adaptation and
relieve selection imposed by the environment. MsDpo4 is a Y-family dPol
from Mycobacterium smegmatis and, sequence and structural analysis
suggested that this enzyme may be endowed with unique properties. DNA
polymerases have bulky aromatic residues at their active site, which forms
a steric gate for selection of deoxyribonucleotides. The steric gate is
absent in MsDpo4 and this enzyme is capable of incorporating
ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides. Using different DNA substrates,
we have attempted to discern the importance of this activity in DNA repair
and translesion synthesis. I aim to carry out a rigorous biochemical and
structural characterisation of MsDpo4 and the progress made in this
direction will be presented. <br> Role of Ezh2 in Skin Wound Healing </br><br>Tissue repair is an essential physiological process to
maintain the homeostasis. Any impairment in this process leads to
pathological condition. Skin wound healing is a complicated process
involving intricate interplay of various cell types such as immune cells,
keratinocytes and fibroblasts. In recent years there has been a lot of
interest in understanding the role of epigenetic regulators particularly
Histone Modifiers in skin development process. In this context, histone
modifications governed by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) catalytic
subunit, Enhancer of Zester Homolog 2 (Ezh2) is known to maintain the
proliferative potential and repress undesirable differentiation program in
skin. In fact, Ezh2 cKO mice demonstrate reduced basal keratinocyte
proliferation and untimely expression of differentiation markers. In
normal skin wound repair there has been only one report showing reduced
expression of Ezh2 and its activity upon wounding. To gain functional and
mechanistic insights of how methyl marks dictate the outcome of skin
repair, we are making use of small molecule inhibitor of Ezh2 histone
methyl transferase activity and its effect on wound healing using a mouse
model. Our data towards this shows depletion of H3K27me3 mark leads to
reduced proliferation and impaired wound-healing response. Further studies
are in progress towards understanding the molecular mechanism behind this
process. <br> Mapping Time To Hippocampal CA1 Sequences </br><br>The mammalian hippocampus is considered important for the
formation of several kinds of memory, one type of which is the association
between stimuli/events occurring separately in time. Trace Eye-Blink
conditioning (TEC) is one such hippocampus dependent behavioural paradigm,
wherein animals maintain a representation of a previously neutral
stimulus, across a stimulus-free ?Trace? interval, and associate this
first stimulus with an eye-blink eliciting air-puff. Previous studies have
shown CA1 activity sequences that bridge the time gap, and emerge as a
function of single-day learning of TEC, in mice (Modi et al., 2014).
My experiments aim to understand these neuronal sequences more, by
studying how consistent they are,
i. Over long periods of time (several days),
ii. As a function of behavioural relevance, viz., CS+ vs. CS-, and iii. As
a function of the ?Trace? interval (time gap), itself.
I will discuss my results with setting up a chronic (multi-day) TEC
paradigm, at this AWS. I will also discuss my strategy to measure the
activity of the same CA1 cells over many days, by 2-photon imaging. <br> Olfactory signalling in blackbuck leks </br><br>Leks are communal display grounds on which males aggregate
during breeding season to defend small, clustered, resource-less
territories, that females visit to choose mates. The number of matings is
highly skewed towards the centre of the lek with 70-80% of matings occur
at the centre. Strong mating bias towards the centre of the lek suggests a
positional bias in female choice and a centripetal variation in the
quality of males. The difference in male quality can be assessed by
females through several cues like morphology, behaviour, auditory and
olfactory signals. The Indian blackbuck (Antilope cerviacpra) is the only
lekking mammal endemic to the Indian Subcontinent and is a good system to
investigate factors affecting female choice. Male blackbucks on the lek
spend a lot of time in making and maintaining dung piles. Females who
visit the lek for mating also spend considerable amount of time sniffing
these dung piles. This suggests that chemical cues from the territorial
dung piles may play a significant role in female choice.
In our study, we aim to investigate the role of olfactory signalling in
blackbuck mating through a combination of behavioural and chemical ecology
based approaches. So far, I have collected fecal samples and conducted
focal behavioural observations for two mating seasons. We have also
identified volatile constituents of 300 fecal samples using GC-MS and have
done some preliminary analyses using the same. <br> Role of Poly (A) binding Protein Nuclear (PABPN) in Planarian
Regeneration </br><br>Planaria with its high regenerative ability is emerging as a
powerful model organism. It has pluripotent adult somatic stem cells,
called as neoblasts, which are responsible for their impressive
regenerative ability. Several studies have shown role of
post-transcriptional gene regulation during planarian regeneration. Our
study aims at understanding the role of an RNA binding protein, Poly A
binding protein nuclear (PABPN), in planarian regeneration. PABPN is well
known to interact with polyadenylation polymerase (PAP) and Cleavage and
polyadenylation specific factor (CPSF) for the polyA tail synthesis of
hnRNA. Interestingly, in planaria Schmidtea mediterranea, we found pabpn
to be enriched in neoblast. Further, knockdown of PABPN resulted in
defects like bloating, immobility and insensitivity towards light,
suggesting an important role of the protein during regeneration. Further,
knockdown of PABPN resulted in defects like bloating, immobility and
insensitivity towards light, suggesting an important role of the protein
during regeneration. PABPN knockdown animals showed defects in stem cell
differentiation along with disorganization of muscle fibers,
photoreceptor, protonephridia and intestinal abnormalities. For further
investigation we are quantifying the expression of various progenitor
markers. Transcriptome analysis identified several genes that were
differentially expressed in KD animals. Interestingly, 25% of the
differentially regulated genes could potentially undergo alternate
polyadenylation suggesting the important role of PABPN is regulating
alternative polyadenylation events essential for cell fate decisions. <br> Primary body axis patterning cues in vertebrate head mesodermdevelopment </br><br><p>Axis patterning during embryonic development of animals is achieved step-?â€wise by a molecular cascade. Opposing cues of Wnt/B-?â€catenin signaling and its inhibition forms the primary cue of the cascade for anterior-?â€posterior (A/P) axis patterning across bilaterians. The role of Wnt signaling and its inhibition in patterning has been studied primarily in the context of the neurectoderm. While the role of Wnt signaling in patterning the posterior mesoderm compartment is understood, it is not clearly understood what role, if any, the primary axis patterning cue of Wnt inhibition plays in mesoderm patterning. Using a directed differentiation assay of mouse embryonic stem cells we show that the primary cue of Wnt inhibition instructs anterior mesoderm patterning. In this AWS, I will describe our results that indicate that Wnt inhibition provides positional information for mesoderm patterning in vertebrates. We are also using mouse as a model system to further examine the necessity of Wnt inhibition in mesoderm patterning. Specifically, it appears that Wnt inhibition drives identity of head mesoderm, positioned anteriorly, which develops into head muscles and contributes to the heart.</p>
 <br> Detecting short-range interactions between transcription factors
through ChIP-seq </br><br>ChIP-seq (Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing) is an
experimental method that provides a list of genomic locations bound by a
transcription factor (TF). In vitro, while a TF's affinity for DNA is
dictated by the sequence being bound, ChIP-seq experiments have shown that
affinity in vivo depends on factors other than the sequence being bound.
One such factor is combinatorial binding with other TFs. In multicellular
eukaryotic genomes, multiple TFs tend to bind close to each other to
regulate a single gene. In these scenarios, one TF's binding could make it
easier, or more difficult, for a second TF to bind nearby due to changes
induced in the shape of DNA, looping, etc. While a handful of instances of
these interactions have been discovered, recent evidence indicates that a
given pairs of TFs may interact while binding at multiple genomic
locations. Our goal is to construct an algorithm to detect locations
where a pair of TFs interact, given their ChIP-seq binding profiles.
I will show some results from running this algorithm on published ChIP-seq
data. I will also demonstrate a method of simulating genome-wide TF-DNA
binding and PCR in order to generate synthetic ChIP-seq data to further
validate our algorithm. <br> Developing a visual-olfactory Virtual Reality Arena to understandhost search strategies </br><br><p>Finding food in the natural world is not an easy task. Typically organisms are either aided by their parents or siblings or have time to spare to learn from their mistakes. Most insects are not so lucky and have to rely on their sensory systems. Single sensory modalities are insufficient to identify objects in a complex world. Integration of multiple sensory modalities reduce ambiguity albeit with an integration problem. Which sensor to use? When and how much? To test these, we use the apple maggot fly (Rhagoletis pomonella) as our model system. The host search behaviour of the fly has been researched for decades, with a complete ethogram, identifying the visual and olfactory preferences. To understand how the fly finds the fruit, we are building a Virtual Reality (VR) arena capable of providing programmable visual and olfactory stimuli. We have shown that flies can fly on a tether and make use of the visual cues from the monitors. They also control their virtual flight trajectory and steer towards specific objects in the virtual world.</p> <br> Structural basis of E2~Ubiquitin conjugate inactivation by
glutamine deamidation </br><br>Bacterial pathogens employ a wide variety of post-tanslational
modifications (PTMs) such as acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination
and AMPylation to alter eukaryotic host protein function to their
advantage. These PTMs are brought about by virulence factors which
comprise of toxins and effectors of the specialised Type III secretion
system (TIIISS). In recent years, enzymatic deamidation has emerged as an
important and commonly used PTM for promoting virulence. This is brought
about by deamidases which catalyse the non-reversible conversion of a
single but highly specific glutamine (Q) residue within the target protein
to a glutamate (E) by removal of an amino group. This results in a local
increase in the negative charge of the protein and an overall increase in
mass by 1 Da. Bacterial deamidases belong to the papain-like superfamily
characterised by a cysteine-based catalytic triad and maybe subdivided
into distinct families based on their modular architecture. Among the
various families of deamidases, the Cycle Inhibiting Factors (Cifs) are
TIIISS effectors that have been found to disrupt the host cell cycle
through disruption of the ubiquitin-mediated signalling/degradation.
 Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification (PTM) involving
the covalent attachment of an 8.5 kDa Ubiquitin (Ub) tag to a
substrate protein. It is a three step enzymatic cascade which broadly
involves the action of E1, E2 and E3 enzymes in a sequential manner. The
first step involves the formation of an E1~Ub thioester conjugate in an
ATP-dependent manner. Next, Ub is transferred to an E2 enzyme in a
transthiolation reaction. Following formation of the E2~Ub
conjugate, non-covalent interactions with E3 enzymes promote
mono/polyubiquitination of various cellular substrates through the
formation of an isopeptide bond with a substrate/Ub lysine. E3 enzymes are
broadly classified into the RING/U-box and HECT type. RING/U-box E3
ligases facilitate the direct transfer of Ub from E2 onto substrate while
HECT E3 ligases possess a catalytic cysteine that forms a E3~Ub thioester
intermediate prior to Ub conjugation of substrate.
Polyubiquitin chains may adopt an open or compact conformation depending
on the position of lysine (K) involved in linking Ub monomers.
K11/48-linked polyubiquitin chains which adopt a closed conformation, are
specifically recognised by the 26S proteasome for substrate destruction.
 Cif secreted by Burkholderia pseudomallei exhibits exquisite
specificity towards position 40 (Q40) in Ub. Interestingly, Ub Q40
deamidation drastically lowers ubiquitination efficiency for several E2-E3
pairs without affecting the rate of formation of E1~Ub and E2~Ub
conjugates [3]. We have employed the use of molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations and NMR spectroscopy to understand the structural basis of
E2~Ub conjugate inactivation. Nanosecond timescale MD simulations of free
Ub suggest that deamidation triggers the formation of
stable/recurring intramolecular salt bridges between E40 and arginine
72/74 in the C-terminal tail of Ub which are spatially proximal. The
NMR-dervied ensemble of Ub Q40E supports our observations from MD
simulations. MD simulations of the E2~Ub Q40E conjugate in the
RING-activated closed conformation [4] also resulted in the same
intramolecular salt bridges which disrupted the optimal orientation of Ub
C-terminal tail and thioester bond in the active site cleft of E2. In
addition, deamidation-induced salt bridges also distorted the orientation
of Ub with respect to E2. Severe distortion of Ub orientation resulted in
a complete disruption of the E2-Ub interface in one MD trajectory. In
conclusion, our results from MD simulations and NMR spectroscopy
collectively suggest a plausible structural basis for deamidation-induced
E2~Ub inactivation that is consistent with previous experimentally-derived
structural models.

regeneration through function </br><br>Light sensing and processing is inherent to almost all animals.
It is hypothesized that, complexity of an organisms photoreceptor organ
and its evolution is related to the difficulty of visually guided behavior
it has to perform. Flatworms like planarians are known to have a
rudimentary cup-like eye that is involved in simple light and directional
sensing, mediated through the photoreceptor cells. While planarians have
long known to avoid light (are negatively phototactic), we discovered that
light mediated behavior in the model organism Schmidtea mediterranea
appeared to be more complex than previously reported. Therefore, to better
understand this light sensing, we have established quantitative assays to
record specific light induced behavior and movement in planarians.
Contrary to previous understanding, we show that planarian flatworms can
discriminate between closely spaced light wavelengths (>25 nm apart) with
maximal fidelity, likely through comparative processing of highly similar
visual inputs while still using a broad sensing photosensor. Specifically,
after decapitation, planarians can regenerate their entire cephalic
ganglion (brain) as well as sensory organs, including eyes. Using unique
light-induced behavior that we observed, we have probed neuronal and
visual center/eye regeneration. Our assays show that we can temporally
delineate regeneration and separate single-input light sensing from
wavelength discrimination. The results suggest that while light avoidance
may be a product of rudimentary neuronal signaling, the ability to resolve
different light inputs requires finer network level processing/computing.
Our results have challenged the conventional view of the planarian eye as
a rudimentary light detector. Planarians also show strong extraocular
photoreception, allowing for an unprecedented interrogation of the dynamic
interactions between the ocular and extraocular photoresponse systems. Our
work brings to the fore, the power of the planarian model wherein new
questions on visual processing and regeneration of neural networks can now
be addressed. <br> Structure-function analysis of glycans in regeneration and
homeostasis: using planaria as the model system </br><br>Cell surface is encapsulated by a dense array of glycans
(carbohydrates) covalently attached to proteins and lipids (glycoprotein
and glycolipid). Glycans were initially thought to be structural
components that impart negative charge to the cell. However, in the recent
past several lines of evidence suggest that glycans contain biological
information essential for cell-cell, cell-matrix, host-pathogen and
receptor-ligand interaction. In this study we took a systems-approach to
understand the role of glycans in planarian S.mediterranea ? a tractable
model system to study regeneration. Whole worm N-glycome analysis by
MALDI-TOF, TOF/TOF and GC-EIMS reveal the presence of novel isomeric
species of N-glycans composed of polyGalactosylated(n=1-6)-Fucose attached
to the core of High mannose and Pauci-mannose type N-glycans. Furthermore,
a majority of the N-glycans were found to be extensively methylated. 
Likewise, a similar analysis on FACS sorted cells was performed to
determine the spatial distribution of N-glycans across different cell
types. It was found that the distribution of glycans across cell types was
not uniform with enrichment of glycans predominantly in the X2 type
(mixture of progenitor and differentiated cells). These results suggest a
novel extension to the biosynthetic pathway of N-glycans which may be a
consequence of enhanced galactosyl transferase activity. The methylation
of glycans is a rare phenomenon observed till date only in nematodes and
molluscs. This study demonstrates that methylation also occurs in
platyhelminthes. The spatial distribution of glycans across cell types
indicates that glycans perform cell-specific functions. <br> Robustness of chemical switches in sustaining memory </br><br>Memory can be stored in chemical reaction networks which show
bistable dynamics. At arrival of a memory induction stimulus, the vector
of the concentrations of reacting moieties may change from one stable
fixed point to the other. Certain reaction motifs, such as positive
feedback loops [Wilhelm, 2009] are known to give rise to bistability, and
certain others, augment core feedback motifs to stabilize them [Pfeuty et
al, 2009].
In biological systems, these chemical reaction networks are typically
exposed to different kinds of perturbations, and need to sustain their
dynamical behaviour for normal system function. Here, we exhaustively
extract all bistable reaction systems from the chemistry possible with up
to 4 reacting entities and 6 reactions [Ramakrishnan et al, 2008]. Then,
we explore the robustness of these small bistable chemical reaction
networks to changes in reaction topology, parameters, and intrinsic noise
[Chang et al 2010; Cheng et al, 2008] to probe if one kind of perturbation
extends to others. We found very little correlation between the three
robustnesses. On the contrary, we find certain topological features that
are enriched for one kind of robustness, and may compromise others. We are
now looking at examples of extreme robustness of each kind to predict
general topological features, which can be expected in biochemistry under
constraints posed by different kinds and combinations of perturbations. <br> Characterization Of Vinculin Conditional Knockout Mouse: A RoleIn Regulating Bulge Stem Cell Quiescence </br><br><p>Vinculin, a mechano-coupling, focal adhesion protein is found almost exclusively at both cell-cell and cell-substratum junctions where it links the actin cytoskeleton to the junctions .It acts as a docking protein for several focal adhesion partners and alpha-actinin at cell-cell junctions there by regulating several signaling pathways induced by mechanical forces. Constitutive knock out of vinculin in mouse results in embryonic lethality due to defects in cell adhesion and migration suggesting its importance in embryonic development. Earlier analysis has shown variable expression of vinculin in bulge stem cells of the hair follicle, which is the main pool of quiescent stem cells in the skin. In order to study the role of vinculin in mouse skin, a conditional K14 driven knock out was generated in skin epidermis. We observed that the vinculin knockout mice displayed loss of hair and acceleration of the hair follicle cycle, which interestingly did not lead to complete hair loss. Label retaining experiment performed by pulsing with Brdu and chasing for several weeks revealed that the bulge stem cells fail to maintain their quiescence in the KO, which may explain the continuous cycling of the hair follicles. Thus, the question we are trying to address is how does the loss of vinculin, a mechano-transducer result in loss of stem cell quiescence. And what role if any, the stem cell niche may play in this. This study will help understand the underlying mechanism that affects the normal hair follicle cycle and the signaling required to maintain the quiescence of hair follicle stem cells.</p> <br> Role of Cx35 mediated gap junctions in chemical synaptogenesis </br><br>Neurons communicate with each other through synaptic contacts

Title : Modification of spider web architecture induced by the larva of a
parasitoid
Link : http://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40555-015-0119-6
Abstract :
The polysphinctine wasp, Acrodactyla quadrisculpta, is a koinobiont
ecto-parasitoid of spiders and is narrowly associated with the biology of
its spider hosts. The larva, attached to the dorsal side of the abdomen,
develops while the spider continues foraging. Shortly before pupation, the
parasitoid larva manipulates the web-building activity of the host in
order to construct a safe shelter against natural elements and predators
during parasitoid pupation.
All are welcome.

Vrinda

Dear all,
Kruttika will be presenting the following paper at the EEJC this Wednesday
(15th June) at 2.00 PM.
Venue : Endosome, FFSH, SLC
Title : Modification of spider web architecture induced by the larva of a
parasitoid
Link : http://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40555-015-0119-6
Abstract :
The polysphinctine wasp, Acrodactyla quadrisculpta, is a koinobiont
ecto-parasitoid of spiders and is narrowly associated with the biology of
its spider hosts. The larva, attached to the dorsal side of the abdomen,
develops while the spider continues foraging. Shortly before pupation, the
parasitoid larva manipulates the web-building activity of the host in
order to construct a safe shelter against natural elements and predators
during parasitoid pupation.
All are welcome.
Regards,
Vrinda

Time : 2.00 PM <br> How to extract more information from steady state data? A case
study of laza mutant in Drosophila melanogaster </br><br>Steady state concentrations of different system components
provide important information for understanding regulation of reaction
cascades. Change in steady state after perturbation of any system
components can provide information about topology of the reaction cascade.
We have taken Drosophila PIP2 cycle as a model system to study the steady
state behaviour of a system under enzymatic perturbation. We consider the
implications of the existence of a cycle of reactions that replenish PIP2
after its depletion during a phototransduction event in the Drosophila
eye. Such a cycle puts constraints on the dynamic steady state that exists
in the absence of light, and makes predictions about the effect of over-
or under-expression of different enzymes in the cycle, on this steady
state. We further use a mathematical model of the PIP2 cycle to shed light
on the possible role of laza mutant in PIP2 cycle. Our analysis suggests
that DAG produced from PA via action of LPP is probably not involved in
phototransduction and we also predict PLD as a possible source for PIP2
cycle. <br> : Investigating the role of Octopamine receptors in central brain
neurons in regulating Drosophila flight </br><br>Oamb receptors (Octopamine receptor in mushroom bodies) are
G-protein coupled receptors in Drosophila which are predominantly
expressed in brain and in reproductive organsi. Flies lacking octopamine,
the ligand of Oamb receptors, are severely flight defective and the
phenotype in neuronalii. A recent study reported the role of central
dopaminergic Protocerebral Anterior Medial (PAM) neurons in Drosophila
flightiii. These PAM neurons are reported to have octopamine receptors
specifically Oamb receptorsiv. Since octopamine in neurons are already
implicated in regulating flight and Oamb receptors being present in the
previously reported flight regulating PAM neurons, it is interesting to
investigate the role of these receptors in regulating flight. In this AWS,
I will be discussing how Oamb receptors in PAM neurons regulate flight,
especially how octopaminergic neurons connect to PAM neurons and further
downstream neurons through mushroom body to regulate flight.

signalling proteins </br><br>The Src family kinases (SFKs) are involved in multiple signal
transduction pathways that regulate fundamental cellular processes.
Evidence suggests that the spatio-temporal activation of key signaling
nodes, such as SFKs, are very precisely regulated and their dynamic
patterns would be dependent on the context and cellular output. Classical
biochemical and protein depletion approaches are limiting and cannot
provide the dynamic sub-cellular information of these molecules. However,
biosensors and probes can report on cellular dynamics and have far
reaching impact in numerous applications including visualizing
spatio-temporal protein activation events and addressing the importance of
specific protein-protein interactions in the complex 'interactome'
paradigms involving key signaling nodes. In this study, we had explored
various strategies to build sensors that helped us to visualized dynamics
SFK Fyn in living cells. These efforts were part of a program to build
biosensors that can report the activation of individual SFKs, since the
roles played by the individual members of the SFK in cell migration and
cell fate determination are not clear. In this presentation, I will be
specifically present the construction and characterization of
conformational sensitive intramolecular and intermolecular FRET based Fyn
kinase biosensors. For generating intramolecular sensors, DNA sequences
encoding the FRET pair fluorescent proteins were inserted at various
locations within the kinase using flexible linkers. We also optimized the
dynamic range of biosensors by tweaking the linker sequences and position
of insertions. The best
biosensor was found to be conformational sensitive and showed the high
FRET with constitutively active (open conformation) compared to WT Fyn
kinase in fluorescence spectroscopy of in HEK293 cell suspension. In
parallel we were also explored strategy of generating a FRET signal when
the active form of the kinase is recognized by a suitably labeled
artificially-engineered binding protein in living cells. This strategy is
generally applicable and can be used in the study of signaling targets,
including for targets that have been difficult to study using conventional
techniques due to limitations of size, post-translational modifications
etc. <br> tRNA-Derived Small RNAs: A Role in Stem Cell Differentiation </br><br>Cellular differentiation is a complex process. Transitions
from a stem to differentiated state require control of gene expression at
transcriptional, post-transcriptional and translation level. Studying the
regulatory mechanisms in this process will help understand the biology of
cellular transitions. This work explores the control of cellular
transitions at the post-transcriptional/translational level by small RNAs
using stem cell differentiation as a paragon for cell state transitions.
Here, we identified a pool of small RNAs that were enriched upon
differentiation by comparing small RNA profiles from mouse embryonic stem
cells (ESCs) and retinoic acid (RA) induced differentiating ESCs. Upon
further probing, these small RNAs of ~33nt mapped to tRNAs, specifically
to the 5?-tRNA half. Interestingly, these small RNAs seem to be produced
in abundance during early differentiation and reached levels comparable to
the stem cell after complete differentiation. High-throughput sequencing
of isolated fractions from polysome profiles revealed associations of
tsRNAs in translating pools (80S and Polysome) suggesting a strong role
for these tsRNAs in translation fine-tuning. Remarkably, in vitro
experiments using tsRNA mimics confirmed tsRNAs as translation repressors.
Electron microscopy of the in vitro translation lysates treated with tsRNA
mimics showed formation of large aggregates suggesting that they could
form large translational repression complexes. This data is supported by
the protein interactome identified through tsRNA pulldowns. In vitro mRNA
pulldowns using tsRNA mimics reveal association of tsRNAs with
pro-stemness transcripts during differentiation and vice versa. Similar
tsRNA enrichments were observed in other systems such as epidermal stem vs
non-stem compartments and cancer lines suggesting generic roles of these
tsRNAs in translational regulation. Together, we propose a role for tsRNAs
in translational control/stalling of specific pools of mRNA to facilitate
efficient cellular differentiation. <br> Understanding the relationship between Cx35 encoded gap junctions
and chemical synapses. </br><br>Neurons form two kinds of synapses ?gap junctions and chemical
synapses. Gap junctions form cytoplasmic bridges between cells which
allow fast exchange of ions and small molecules. Gap junctions appear
earlier during development as compared to chemical synapses. Also,
disrupting the electrical synapses can affect chemical transmission. These
observations
have led to a notion that electrical synapses might affect the formation
of chemical synapses. In order to address this question I will focus on
the cerebellar Purkinje neurons of zebrafish. So far I have validated that
injecting the morpholino antisense oligonucleotide leads to the knockdown
of Cx35 protein. I will also show some of the ongoing work regarding the
effect of this knockdown on inhibitory synapses.
TITLE 2 - Understanding the role played by granule cells and eurydendroid
cells during motor adaptation. When presented with the moving gratings,
the zebrafish tries to stabilize itself by swimming in the direction of
perceived flow (optomotor response). On changing the feedback, fish
readily adapts by modulating its swim. It has previously been shown in
larval zebrafish that the cells of the cerebellum are active during this
behaviour. But what happens at the cellular level is still unknown. This
entire circuitry involved in motor learning can be studied in zebrafish
because of ease of genetics and in vivo electrophysiology. So I would like
to record from two cell types of the cerebellum namely, granule cells and
eurydendroid cells during motor learning. I will show patch clamp
recordings from these cells and suction recording from motor neurons along
with whole cell recording from the cerebellum. <br> Golgi cisternal maturation in a minimal Boolean vesicle traffic model </br><br>The vesicle traffic system of eukaryotic cells is responsible
for movement of molecules across cellular compartments. In this
sense,ultimately, the functional identities of eukaryotic compartments,
and their dynamics are set up by the traffic system. Through experiments,
a lot of the key molecular players of the vesicle traffic system, and
their modes of interactions have been uncovered. This has enabled us to
gain a mechanistic understanding of the traffic process. Mathematical
models of vesicle traffic strive to understand the principles by which
observable properties of the cellular compartments can be achieved using
the molecular machinery of traffic. In this work, We have developed a
Boolean model of vesicle traffic using which we statistically sample
molecular networks to answer two questions: (a) What are the properties of
all possible molecular networks that lead to traffic systems with
real-cell like properties, and (b) what is the scope of compartment
dynamics and cellular topologies that is achievable using local molecular
interactions that can be encoded in these networks. In our analysis, we
find that a significant fraction of traffic systems sampled by our method
hold real-cell like properties. In particular, sets of compartments in the
model that form maturation chains hold a peculiar pattern; compartments
almost always send vesicles to the previous (younger) compartment in the
maturation chain. This pattern is reminiscent of cisternal maturation that
is observed in the Golgi apparatus. All mathematical model of the Golgi in
the literature assume cisternal maturation to be a consequence of spatial
ordering of the compartments. Our results indicate that local molecular
interactions of vesicle traffic by themselves are capable of producing
cisternal maturation in the Golgi system. <br> Role of mechanosensory and visual inputs in head stabilization
of moths </br><br>Flying insects experience substantial optic flow during aerial
maneuvers, which must be stabilized for stable flight. Unlike animals with
movable gaze, insect eyes are fixed relative to their head. Thus, gaze
stabilization requires constant head movements during flight that are
correlated with combined pitch, roll and yaw turns. In Dipteran flies,
head stabilization is controlled via inputs from both visual feedback from
eyes and mechanosensory feedback from their gyrosensory halteres, in
addition to the mechanosensory prosternal organs which are thought to
maintain the head position. It is not known however, how non-Dipteran
insects, which do not possess halteres, derive the equivalent
mechanosensory input. Previous studies have implicated antennal
mechanosensory role in flight control. Hence, we hypothesized that
non-dipteran insects use antennal mechanosensory feedback to stabilize
head and gaze. An alternative, but not mutually exclusive hypothesis, is
that head stabilization is driven primarily via visual feedback. To test
these hypotheses, we conducted a series of experiments in the oleander
hawkmoth, Daphnis nerii. In my seminar, I will present data to show that
head stabilization is a product of visual as well as antennal
mechanosensory feedback <br> : Studying neuromodulation of honey bee behavior using single
brain mass spectrometry </br><br>Honeybees are excellent model systems to study natural behavior
under experimentally manipulable conditions and there are many studies
that use whole brain neuromodulator levels as a way to understand what
drives behavior. My work deals with using mass spectrometry to measure
amounts of neurotransmitters in single honey bee brains to study the
well-known honey bee dance as well as the effects of the circadian clock
on neurotransmitter titers.
In my last AWS I showed that neurotransmitter levels are different between
bees that were caught from within the hive at 2AM and at 8AM.
Interestingly, we found that major biogenic amine levels were higher at
night than during the morning.
In this AWS, I will present the results of an experiment done to
understand these changes as well as the results the project dealing with
the individual variation in dance. <br> ER calcium release by IP3R regulates protein synthesis in
neuropeptidergic cells. </br><br>The IP3 receptor (IP3R) is one of two receptors known to gate
ER stored calcium and thus is a key effector of calcium signalling.
Depending on cell type and environment, calcium released from ER stores
regulates events that profoundly effect cellular function and ultimately,
animal physiology. One fundamental cellular process is protein synthesis
and integration of calcium signalling into this process is not well
understood. Protein synthesis is typically turned off when a cell is
subjected to nutritional stress, however, in a developing organism,
survival demands continued protein synthesis in at least certain cell
types, like neural stem cells. My study extends this observation to cells
that make neuropeptides, which unlike neuroblasts, are post-mitotic and
differentiated. Reduction of protein synthesis via down-regulation of InR
and TOR signaling molecules in neuropeptidergic cells impairs Drosophila
larvae development to pupariation, under nutritional stress.
Concomitantly, genetic up-regulation of insulin and TOR signalling
pathways, or store-calcium signalling molecules in neuropeptidergic cells
is sufficient to rescue the survival of an hypomorphic IP3R mutant on an
amino-acid free diet. Additionally, in vivo measurements of protein
synthesis undertaken in neuropeptidergic cells reveals lower rate of
protein synthesis upon loss of IP3R. Together, these investigations
demonstrate a role for IP3R mediated calcium signalling in regulating
protein synthesis, which appears to determine the ability of a developing
animal to survive nutrient stress. <br> Septins are key modulators of store-operated Ca2+ entry in neurons. </br><br>Intracellular Ca2+ plays a crucial role in a variety of
cellular processes starting from fertilization to gene transcription
necessary for expression of genes required for formation and maturation of
neuronal circuits. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) serves as an important
reservoir of Ca2+ in cells. A variety of signals can activate cell surface
G-protein coupled receptors or Receptor Tyrosine Kinases leading to
generation of Inositol-1, 4, 5-trisphosphate (IP3) which subsequently
binds to and opens the IP3-receptor (IP3R), a Ca2+ channel on the ER
membrane. This results in a release of the ER Ca2+ stores. This drop in ER
Ca2+ levels is sensed by STIM proteins which subsequently oligomerize and
translocate to ER-PM junctions where they physically bind to and open the
plasma-membrane resident Ca2+ channel, Orai. Opening of the Orai channel
allows uptake of extracellular Ca2+ into the cytosol, a process termed
?Store-operated Ca2+ entry?. Septins are a class of filament-forming
GTPases that form a variety of cellular structures, which among others can
act as a diffusion barrier for PM-resident proteins or as molecular
adaptors that allow assembly of signaling proteins. In my previous AWS, I
have shown that using genetic, behavioural and cellular studies, I found
an important role for a particular septin, Septin 7 in regulation of Ca2+
entry through Orai in neurons in Drosophila. In this AWS, I will show data
that provides a mechanistic insight into this regulation of Orai by Septin
7 as well as the role of other septins present in cells in modulation of
Orai-mediated Ca2+ entry by Septin 7. <br> Roles of the cell autonomous CLIC/GEEC endocytic process duringpattern formation in Drosophila </br><br><p>Secreted morphogens form spatial gradients and elicit concentration-dependent signalling responses in the receiving cells within a tissue. During development, it is not well understood how the signalling readouts within the receiving cells are initiated and/or maintained. Perturbations of clathrin and dynamin have been used as tools to attribute functions of canonical endocytosis in signal transduction and thus in pattern formation. Through my thesis, I am interested in understanding the temporal regulation and control of signal transduction through a clathrin and dynamin independent endocytic process ? CLIC/GEEC pathway. Previously, we have shown that two signalling pathways (Wingless and EGF) are affected by perturbations of CLIC/GEEC endocytosis. In this annual work seminar, I will discuss my ongoing characterization of two signalling systems which can be used to probe the temporal functions of cell-autonomous endocytic processes in signal transduction.</p> <br> Daily Foraging Induced Gene Expression Changes in Honeybees </br><br>: Foraging behavior in honeybees is one of the extensively
studied behaviors. Since the foragers learn the information about the food
source like location, colour, odour etc.; this behavior provides an
opportunity to understand molecular mechanism operating during learning
and memory in semi-natural conditions. The question ?Is daily foraging
activity accompanied by a genomic response ? ? was asked and experiments
were performed to identify genes that might be differentially expressed.
It was found that genes involved in neural activity (egr-1) and learning
and memory (dopamine and ecdysone pathway genes) were upregulated during
foraging. Since the information about the food source was acquired prior
to the experiment, it was hypothesized that reconsolidation might be
underplay during repetitive foraging behavior. <br> Determination of FAT10 structure by NMR Spectroscopy and
molecular insight into FAT10 mediated degradation </br><br>Ubiquitin Proteasome system (UPS) regulates protein levels by
degrading short-lived as well as long-lived proteins such as cell cycle
regulators, transcription factors, metabolic enzymes etc. These protein
substrates gets modified with a transferable degradation signal, such as
ubiquitin (Ub) forming K48-linked poly-Ub chains, via ubiquitin
conjugation mechanism. Among the several known Ubiquitin like modifiers
(ULMs), only FAT10, Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-F Adjacent Transcript
10, acts as degradation signal independent of ubiquitin. Unlike ubiquitin
where poly-UB (K48) chains takes the substrate to proteasome, a single
moiety of FAT10 is potent enough to bring the substrate to the 26S
proteasome. Despite being identified as direct degradation signal more
than a decade ago, the structure of FAT10 and its mechanism for
degradation is still unknown.
Our interest focuses on understanding the mechanism of FAT10 degradation
for which structure determination is vital. We have used NMR spectroscopy
extensively for the structural and dynamical studies. So far, we have
finished the backbone assignment from the NMR data. We have also compared
the stability of FAT10 with Ubiquitin via Guanidium hydrochloride-mediated
unfolding and found that FAT10 is quite unstable as the free energy
required to unfold FAT10 is less than Ubiquitin. Another aspect of our
study is to investigate the interaction between FAT10 and 26S proteasomal
receptor hRpn10, which is a well-known receptor for Ubiquitin. Using 2D
15N-HSQC titration experiments, we have observed the interactions between
hRpn10 and FAT10.
In the near future, the ongoing NMR experiments for distance restrains
would help us to solve the tertiary structure of FAT10. In addition, we
would model the complex of FAT10 with hRpn10 using NMR and further
investigate the role of this complex in degradation of FAT10 mediated
substrates.

recognising mates and, in insects, finding appropriate locations for egg
laying. The neural circuit which processes gustatory information in the
brain of flies is poorly characterized. In first part of the study, we
characterized the organization and development of motor neurons involved
in feeding behavior of Drosophila. In second part, we are characterizing
second order neurons which process information from sensory neurons and
command appropriate behavior. For this, we had done a screen of GAL4 lines
present in the lab. We have found subset of neurons, which process bitter
taste and inhibit feeding. We are also trying to find other neurons which
?talk? with this subset of neurons. This study will help us in
understanding the microcircuit require for the bitter taste avoidance. <br> Effects of increased temperatures on volatile mediated
plant?insect interactions in high altitude meadow ecosystems of the
Eastern Himalayas </br><br>Global change drivers, including climate warming, are likely
to significantly alter interspecies interactions via range shifts as well
as changes in plant phenological patterns, ultimately affecting community
and ecosystem processes. In plants, increased temperature can also affect
the biosynthesis and volatility of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs),
which are crucial in pollinator attraction and defense against herbivores.
At present, there is little known about warming effects on plant?insect
interactions in tropical alpine ecosystems, which are known to be highly
susceptible to global warming.
Our project investigates the effect of increased temperature on floral
VOCs of plants in the high altitude meadow ecosystems in North Sikkim, and
its consequences on the interaction with their associated insects. We
compare floral VOCs released by warmed and un-warmed plants at similar
elevations, as well as across an altitudinal gradient on the VOC spectrum
of conspecific plants.
Our study aims to provide critical insights into potential future changes
in interspecies interaction dynamics for understanding whole-ecosystem
changes. <br> Merkel Cell Polyomavirus: A Unique Paradigm For Understanding
Tumorigenesis </br><br>Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, aggressive skin cancer
occurring in mechanoreceptor Merkel cells, at the basal layer of the
epidermis. In 2008, Feng et al. found a virus clonally integrated in the
tumor genome that redefined our understanding of this disease. Merkel cell
polyomavirus is a member of the many-tumor-forming (poly-oma), dsDNA
family of viruses and expresses two oncoproteins (large and small T
antigens). Of the 13 known human polyomaviruses, MCV is the only one
that has been convincingly shown to cause cancer in humans and is
classified by WHO as a class 2A carcinogen.
Although, a part of the common skin microbiome, MCV causes cancer only in
Merkel cells, in the context of immunosuppression. In the cancer cells,
MCV expresses a truncated form of LT which retains the N-terminal tumor
suppressor targeting domains but is devoid of the replication-important C
terminal domains, otherwise active in the wild-type virus.
We hypothesize that MCV oncoproteins reprogramme differentiated Merkel
cells and that this unique combination of MCV and distinct Merkel
cells are key to the cancer phenotype. To study MCV Large T
antigen&rsquo;s contribution to cancer we have developed a dual
affinity purification method followed by mass-spectrometric analysis.
We are using this approach to investigate novel interactors of MCV
LT, that play an important role in infection and/or tumorigenesis. We
have performed the first set of experiments in HEK293 cells and are
currently validating the hits. We are testing LT expression in dermal
fibroblasts next, as these were recently shown to be the primary
cells that harbor MCV in the skin. Previous work using RNA
interference based knock-down of MCV T antigens leads to cell death,
indicating the importance of these proteins in tumor survival.
Expanding on this knowledge, we are developing a CRISPRi based
knock-down of T antigen expression. This will not only be a useful tool
to probe T antigen function further but also holds great promise as
a potential therapy for MCC.
We have also defined different components of the viral non-coding
regulatory region and will explain how Merkel-cell specific regulation may
be aiding the development of cancer in these cells. Preliminary work
exploring MCV LT&rsquo;s transcriptional regulation of the cellular genome
using ChIP assays and plans for further studies will also be presented. <br> Understanding the unusual fluorescence change in
hyperthermophilic protein Ctd-MK0293 </br><br>Small, single domain hyperthermophilic proteins have
become increasingly important as models for protein folding study. We
have investigated the folding & unfolding mechanism (equilibrium
and kinetic) of the hyperthermophilic protein Ctd-MK0293 (C-terminal
domain of MK0293) using multiple probes (far & near UV-CD,
Fluorescence and NMR). The 83-residue C-terminal domain of MK0293
forms an alpha/beta ubiquitin-like fold. This protein is natively
present in the archaeal methanogen Methanopyrus Kandleri which
survives in temperatures up to 110?C. We observed that Ctd-MK0293
undergo cold denaturation above -40 ?C, in the absence of
chemical denaturants. In addition to this we observed unusually
ultra-slow fluorescence change in folded and unfolded state of
protein. This interesting property provides the unique opportunity to
explore experimentally the molecular mechanism of such ultra-slow
dynamics in native and unfolded state of protein. <br> Effects of stress on astrocytes in the amygdala and hippocampus </br><br>Prolonged duration of stressful experiences have been known
to cause various forms of stress disorders in humans like Major
depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder etc. Most
studies in humans and chronic stress models in rodents alike, have
shown underpinnings of these stress disorders in the form of specific
cellular and biochemical phenotypes seen in the neurons. However, in
the last two decades, studies have elucidated that the astrocytes, a
sub population of glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS),
play a pivotal role in synaptic transmission, modulation and
plasticity apart from being the housekeeping cells. In this light,
astrocytes have become an important cellular candidate to study the
effects of stress on these cells and also their interaction with the
neurons. We aim to understand how stress affects astrocytes in terms
of their structure and function and as a result how these
perturbations modulate stress induced neuronal plasticity. Chronic
immobilization stress (CIS) is known to have contrasting effects on
the neurons of the hippocampus and the amygdala in terms of
structural, synaptic and intrinsic plasticity. We started by asking
if these contrasting phenotypes in neuronal morphology also applies
to the astrocytes. So far, my studies show a significant changes in
the number GFAP positive astrocytes in the basal amygdala. Further,
in order to understand the effects of stress on astrocyte morphology
and astrocyte-neuron interactions, we have done intracellular dye
filling of these cells in order to get high resolution information on
single cell morphology. CIS causes a reduction in the neuropil volume
occupied by the astrocytes in basolateral amygdala. The results also
show a very stark difference in the arborisation profiles of these
cells between hippocampal CA3 region, Basal and Lateral amygdala.
Currently, experiments are in progress to study the effects of stress
on the astrocyte-neuron interactions at a synaptic level. Two major
questions being addressed are 1) how many synapses a single astrocyte
associates with and 2) Is there a region specific difference in the
glutamate re-uptake machinery of astrocytes. <br> Information exchange in mate choice </br><br>In sexually reproducing organisms, the choice of mate can have a
large effect on the fitness of an organisms offspring. However, collecting
the information needed for a good choice is hindered by biological
limitations in what can be measured at all, noise in whatever measurements
are made and finally active attempts at deception by other organisms.
Furthermore, transmitting, collecting and verifying information can carry
costs of their own. This can create a selection pressure to develop
information transfer schemes that are both robust (immune to noise and
errors) and efficient (carry as much relevant information as possible with
the least cost). I am currently setting up a framework to model this
class of problems. Specifically, I am trying to examine how rugged or
variable fitness landscapes will interact with the problem of
communicating with a mate. <br> Integrative modelling of TRIF- towards understanding the
structural basis of TLR-3:TRIF interactions </br><br>TRIF is a key protein in antiviral innate immunity, operating
downstream of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). The activation of TRIF leads to
the production of interferon-&#946; and pro-inflammatory cytokines. There
is evidence from experiments to suggest that the N-terminal domain of TRIF
binds to its TIR domain to avoid constitutive activation. However, no
structure of a complex between the N-terminal domain and the TIR domain
exists till date. The disordered nature of the region connecting the
N-terminal domain and the TIR domain compounds the issue of elucidating
the mechanism of autoinhibition of TRIF. In this study, we have employed
an integrative approach consisting of docking, molecular dynamic
simulations and residue network analysis, in combination with existing
experimental data, to provide a glimpse of TRIF in its autoinhibited
state. Our results suggest that the N-terminal domain binds to the BB loop
region of the TIR domain, thereby preventing its oligomerisation. The
binding of TRIF to TLR-3 or TRAM could induce a slight conformational
change, causing the interactions between the N-terminal domain and TIR
domain to disrupt, thereby exposing the BB loop and rendering it amenable
for forming higher-order oligomers. <br> Gluconeogenesis regulates morphogenetic switching in Saccharomycescerevisiae. </br><br><p>Unicellular organisms employ multiple strategies to adapt to changing environments around them. Once such strategy deployed by unicellular organisms is the formation of complex communities. During this typically reversible transition from a unicellular form to a complex community, cells are thought to undergo division of labor wherein different cells of the community may perform distinct specialized functions. This process of ?cellular specialization? is thought to be critical for the survival of these facultative multicellular communities. Fungal morphogenesis is one such process wherein fungal cells can reversibly switch from a sessile unicellular state to numerous types of facultative multicellular forms including biofilms (liquid medium), rugose mat biofilms (solid medium), hyphae/pseudohyphae, flocculation etc. to name a few. These morphogenetic changes allows the fungi to quickly adapt to varying environmental conditions and even thrive in them. Traditional studies have focused on identifying genes involved in these morphogenetic behaviors. However, we lack an understanding of the fundamental organizing principles behind such behavior. We hypothesize that specific metabolic demands of these aforementioned fungal pathogens in a particular host niche are primary determinants of fungal morphogenesis, with key metabolic events driving these morphogenetic changes. While currently poorly exploited, S. cerevisiae can serve as an excellent model for understanding metabolic regulations of fungal morphogenesis as it can reversibly switch from a single-cell form to multiple distinct types of complex communities. These complex communities formed by S. cerevisiae appear to show spatial organization, morphological differences, and can survive harsh environmental conditions. Such features in S. cerevisiae includes flocculation, biofilm formation, and invasive or pseudohyphal growth of cells. We therefore propose to address this hypothesis by using biofilms with rugose morphology (BRM)(solid medium) and liquid culture biofilms as outputs of fungal morphogenesis. Our initial findings show that S. cerevisiae can form robust BRMs when grown at low glucose conditions, in contrast to the uniform, smooth colonies they form when glucose is abundant. We also have discovered gluconeogenesis to be a critical process for this morphogenetic change, and observe that the availability of free amino acids are critical for the formation of BRMs.</p> <br> Exploring the role of E2-2 in microglial homeostasis and function </br><br>. Microglia are the tissue resident macrophages of the brain. In
addition to their role as the resident immune cell of the central nervous
system, these cells play important roles in developmental and homeostatic
processes in the brain. They originate from erythromyeloid progenitors in
yolk sac, and colonize the brain during early development. Unlike other
macrophages, microglia have an unusually long lifespan, and are thought to
be maintained by self-renewalin situ. However, the molecular mechanisms
that underlie the long lifespan and dynamic functions of microglia remain
poorly understood.The aim of my study is to explore the potential role of
E2- 2 in microglial homeostasis and function. E2-2 is the only member of
the E-protein family of basic-Helix-Loop-Helix(bHLH) transcription factors
that is abundantly and continually expressed in the adult mammalian brain,
with little known about its function(s). Notably, E2-2 is associated with
multiple neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, including
Schizophrenia and Autism. A role of E2-2 in the developing brainhas been
recently reported. However, the functional significance of E2-2 in the
adult brain remains largely unclear. Earlier reports have established
importance of E2-2 in cell-fate determination and morphological and
functional maintenance of a myeloid Lineage immune cell type. These
specific cellular regulations could be relevant for a dynamic, yet
long-living cell type, such as microglia. Given this, we hypothesized a
role for E2-2 in microglial maintenance and/or function.
In this annual work seminar, I will discussmy preliminary observations
which suggest a potential role of E2-2 in microglia. <br> Evolutionary Dynamics of Butterfly Mimicry Rings. </br><br>An ecological community is defined as a group of species that
coexist and interact within a defined area. Innumerable evolutionary and
ecological processes come into play in shaping the species composition of
a community. We are pursuing the role of interspecific interactions and
their evolutionary relationships in community assembly. A butterfly
mimicry ring is an example of an ecological community where mimetic
species that possess a common aposematic pattern occur. A ring could have
both M?llerian mimics (Mutualists) and Batesian mimics (Parasites). In
this study, we are looking at the evolutionary assembly, structure and
diversity of the mimicry rings found in North East India in the light of
these mutualistic and parasitic interactions. <br> Structure-function studies of Glucosamine 6-phosphate deaminase
(NagB) from various pathogenic gram-negative bacteria </br><br>The emergence of resistance in common pathogens has created a
need to develop newer antimicrobial agents. In this project, we aim to
develop inhibitors of sialic acid (nine carbon sugars N-acetyl neuraminic
acid and its derivatives) scavenging pathway that is present in a class of
gram negative bacteria. These bacteria incorporate the scavenged sialic
acid as the outer-most sugar in their LOS. This incorporation allows them
to carry out molecular mimicry and cause sepsis, as well as survive as
biofilms.
There are various genes involved in the sialic acid scavenging pathway.
Primarily, I will be focusing on Glucosamine 6-phosphate deaminase (NagB)
from various pathogenic gram-negative bacteria. NagB is an aldose-ketose
isomerase that performs deamination and isomerization reaction. In
particular, it is involved in the final step in the sialic acid scavenging
pathway converting D-glucosamine 6-phosphate to D-fructose 6-phosphate and
ammonia. This gene is conserved among several bacterial and fungal
species. However, there is very little enzymology, and structure-function
studies carried out on these proteins, although there is some work done on
the human enzymes that carry out this reaction.
In our work, we have cloned and expressed these genes from three different
pathogenic bacteria, H. influenzae (Hi), F. nucleatum (Fn), and
P.multocida (Pm) as soluble protein. Following this, we have purified
these proteins and setup initial crystallization trials. We have been
successful in collecting data and determining the preliminary structures.
We are now in the process of structure refinement and structure-function
studies. Currently, I am designing experiments to perform more
crystallization trials, and thermodynamics and kinetic studies using ITC
and relevant kinetic assays. <br> Spatial Organization of microtubule post-translational modifications </br><br><p>Microtubules are the major eukaryotic cytoskeletal element of the cell which are made up of alpha/beta tubulin heterodimer. Inside the cell they serve as a scaffold to determine cell shape and are involved in several form of cellular locomotion and transport. These are dynamic polymer that undergoes polymerization and depolymerization of existing assembly to reorganize it, such phenomenon is called dynamic instability of microtubules. Cell also possess stable microtubules that have slower turn-over rate. These stable microtubules form ordered/polarized arrangement during various cellular activity such as cell division and migration, where they function for long distance cargo transport. Several factors have been shown to affect the stability of microtubules, such as microtubule associated proteins (MAPs) and different post translational modification (PTMs), like detyrosination and acetylation. Several proteins and motors interact preferentially with these PTM modified microtubules. Hence, inside the cell what PTMs define the stable microtubule and how they affect their organization remains elusive. All the studies to visualize these modified microtubules are done by antibody staining which uses fixed tissue and does not provide the temporal information of the hierarchy of PTMs that makes microtubule stable. So, I am interested to find out specific live sensors against different PTM tubulins which can mark these modified tubulins inside the cell.</p> <br> Exploring interactions between transporter protein NUB1L in the
Ubiquitin-26S proteasome pathway and the 26S-proteasome receptors </br><br>Protein turnover is essential to maintain cellular homeostasis.
The protein substrates that need to be degraded are modified by attachment
of polyubiquitin chains and directed via transporters to the 26S
proteasome. This complex is recognized by receptors on the 19S regulatory
region and is then sent inside the proteasome to be degraded in the 20S
core peptidase region. In case of immune response, another independent
mechanism for protein degradation signaling exists, which is
FAT10-ylation. HLA-F adjacent transcript 10 (FAT10) is a ubiquitin-like
modifier, and has two ubiquitin like (UBL) domains. The conjugation of a
single FAT10 moiety to the substrate leads to its proteasomal degradation.
 NEDD8 Ultimate Buster-1L (NUB1L) is a transporter of FAT10. It has one
UBL domain at the N terminus and three ubiquitin associated (UBA) domains at
the C terminus. NUB1L binds to FAT10 by its UBA domains and to the
proteasome via its UBL domain, typical of other transporter proteins like
Rad23 and Dsk1. Although the domain architecture of NUB1L is similar to
that of the other transporter proteins, it is a specific transporter for
the FAT10-26S pathway. Moreover, the mode of interaction between
transporters and the proteasomal receptors were found to vary amongst the
various transporters. We plan to investigate the molecular mechanism of
how NUB1L recognizes FAT10-conjugated substrates and transports it to the
proteasome.
In my first AWS, I will discuss my findings for the interaction between
NUB1L and two proteasomal receptors (Rpn13 and S5a). <br> The Chemistry and Evolution of Wing Color Patterns in Papilio
Swallowtail Butterflies </br><br>Papilio swallowtail butterflies have been interesting models
for study of both ecology and genetics for decades. Papilio polytes shows
female limited Batesian mimicry and has three distinct forms- cyrus
(non-mimetic & ancestral), romulus (mimetic) and stichius (mimetic). The
two mimetic forms, romulus and stichius mimic two toxic butteflies
Pachliopta hector, and P. aristolochiae respectively (Kunte, 2009). Recent
studies have shown that these forms are controlled by different alleles of
a single gene doublesex (Dsx) rather than by a supergene (tightly linked
cluster of many genes).(Kunte et al., 2014)(Nishikawa et al., 2015) One of
the phenotypic outcomes of mimicry is an alteration in the wing color
pattern. The mimicry hypothesis postulates that in acquiring mimetic
phenotype a species pays a cost in terms of sexual selection (Kunte,
2009). Presence of fluorescence in wings is regarded as a sexual signal in
butterflies. It has been observed that when a mimetic form appears,
fluorescent signal is lost, which is present in the non-mimetic ancestral
form (Kunte, unpublished). This is seen throughout Papilio. This
fluorescent signal is localized in the white patches present in the
non-mimetic form. The pigment involved in this fluorescent signal is
unknown and the mechanism governing this change is also not understood.
Hence, understanding this can be an important link between ecology of
mimicry and its genetic basis.
I propose to understand the chemical and genetic bases of pigmentation in
Papilio swallowtail butterflies. I will perform chemical analysis of
pigments and genomic analysis of pigmentation pathway genes in various
female forms of Papilio polytes and the toxic species that they mimic. <br> Changing initiator tRNA levels induces mistranslation and alters
response to stress in E.coli </br><br>Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are adaptor molecules that help decode the
genetic code into the language of protein. There are two main classes of
tRNAs, the initiator tRNA which is one of a kind, and the elongator tRNAs,
which are of many kinds. They determine which amino acid is introduced in
response to which mRNA codon and also decide where along an mRNA molecule
a new protein chain should be initiated. Both processes are, however,
prone to errors, and recent evidence suggests that this error rate can be
enhanced by specific stresses.
 Previous work showed that depletion of initiator tRNA (itRNA) in E.coli
leads to translation initiation at non-AUG codons, potentially using amino
acids other than methionine. We term this ?mis-initiation?. As already
tested, this phenomenon is significantly heightened under some stressful
conditions. Given that itRNA levels are known to fall under various
stresses, we are testing the hypothesis that a change in itRNA levels
could mediate a stress response by generating proteome diversity through
mistranslation. To do this, we are using mutant strains that lack one, two
or three of the four itRNA genes in E.coli. As it is an essential
molecule, all four genes cannot be eliminated.
We find that altering itRNAi levels unexpectedly lowers the translation
elongation rate in addition to the initiation rate. Since slowly moving
ribosomes could frameshift more often, we examined frameshifting and found
that the mutant carrying only ~25% of the wild type itRNA amount shows
increased -1 frameshifting as checked using a plasmid based lacZ reporter
assay system. This brings up an additional way to generate protein
diversity within the cell. Interestingly, the frameshifting is
significantly enhanced under selection and enables the mutant to grow well
on lactose as the sole carbon source while the wild type shows very poor
survival on the same substrate due to its inability to frameshift in a -1
frame. The introduction of hyper accurate ribosomes by means of a single
point mutation into the mutant background abolished this frameshifting,
suggesting that the ability of the mutant to frameshift was linked with
mistranslation. A dual luciferase assays system using Renilla and firefly
luciferase also show that frameshifting is enhanced in the mutant while
preliminary results indicate that misincorporation frequencies remain
comparable across wt and mutant strains. In order to examine how the
mutant performs relative to the wild type across a range of growth
environments, we used phenotype micro array plates supplied by Biolog and
measured growth of the wild type and mutant on various carbon and nitrogen
substrates as well as on various antibiotics through reduction of a
tetrazolium dye. The results showed that the two grew comparably across
most substrates, but the mutant did significantly better in the presence
of certain antibiotics, such as carbenicillin, penimipecycline and
novobiocin. Further analysis is underway. The mutant shows significantly
higher viable counts than the wild type when grown under starvation as
well as high temperature (45oC). The growth advantage is again eliminated
by introducing hyper accurate ribosomes, emphasizing the role of
mistranslation. In addition, a mutant with only one itRNA gene strongly
induces the SOS response both at 45oC and under oxidative stress induced
by 5 mM hydrogen peroxide, suggesting that enhanced mutagenesis may also
contribute to stress resistance. However, it is important to note that
basal mutation frequencies in the absence of stress remain comparable
between the wild type and itRNA mutants. We also find that the mutant
inherently has lower internal ROS levels which could play a role in
mediating resistance against certain antibiotics.
We have evolved strains carrying different amounts of itRNA under low
(30oC) and high (45oC) temperature conditions and are now going to analyse
compensatory mutations that have led to an increase in the growth rate. <br> Modelling memories across scales : Role of chemical bistables atsynapse </br><br><p>Biological memory is com posed of multiscale components that operate at diverse time? and spatial?scales. For example, electrical activity in neurons operates at millise cond timescale with mostly localised computation whereas (bistable) chemical networks at synapses operate at hour to month timescale with &quot;diffused&quot; computations. The MOOSE simulator allows integration of these components. This multiscale nature of biological synapse has bee n exploited in a theoretical model to strike a balance between two competing demands put on any model of memory : a high capacity to store new memories and slowest possible rate of forgetting of old memories [Benna and Fusi]. This model suggests that to achieve large storage cap acity with slowest possible delay of stored?memories, very slow bistable biochemical switches are a good candidate for storing (long?term) me mories.</p>

<p>Calcium/calmodulin activated protein Kinase II (CaMKII) is known to exhibit bistable behaviour in physiological conditions. Using MOOSE simulator, I extended CaMKI I model of Miller and Zhabotinsky [Miller et. al, 2005] with recent finding of subunit exchange among CaMKII holoenzymes [Stratton et. al., 2014] in a region of synapse called post?synaptic density (PSD). My model confirms a regime of bistability in physiologically relevant range of parameters. Consistent with previous modelling work, my work shows that bistable switch formed by few tens of CaMKII holoenzymes can remain ON for years despite protein turnover and stochastic noise. Further analysis shows that as the rate of subunit?exchange increas es to physiological relevant time?scales, distribution of states of a system of many bistable CaMKII switches located next to each other becomes very skewed (almost always ON). In other words, a nano?cluster of CaMKII holoenzymes in PSD is most likely to have an ?all or none? rath er than graded effect on synaptic strength. A theoretical framework to analytically solve for steady state distribution of states of bistables using Markov chains is formulated and implemented in python and Haskell languages. In this framework, the computational complexity of solving a syst em of N bistables is reduced to O(N^2) from O(2^N) by a recursive construct. This framework can be used to solve for steady state distribution of states in similar systems such as ion?channels, neural activity among a population of neurons.</p>
 <br> Regulation of neuronal functions by Store-operated calcium entry
in the context of flight circuit development </br><br>. Calcium is an important second messenger and is known to
regulate a variety of cellular processes. Upon extracellular stimulation
by ligands like hormones, neuropeptides, etc. through receptors like the
G-protein coupled receptors internal endoplasmic reticular calcium stores
are depleted. These stores are then replenished by a mechanism known as
SOCE. Apart from replenishing the store, SOCE causes a transient increase
in cytosolic calcium levels triggering various downstream processes, like
inducing gene expression. Transcriptional regulation by SOCE is well
studied in non-excitable cells. However, the role of SOCE has been poorly
documented in neuronal cells with heterogeneous calcium dynamics.
I have been studying the role of SOCE in the developing nervous system of
Drosophila. Previous work from the lab had shown a requirement for SOCE in
Drosophila flight. Through genetic and behavioural experiments, I have
determined that neuronal SOCE in the early pupal stage is critical for
flight circuit development and then, performed a high throughput RNA-seq
to identify SOCE mediated gene expression changes in the developing pupal
nervous system. I have further identified one of the target genes, Ral, a
small GTPase to act downstream of SOCE in regulation of flight. In
collaboration with another colleague in the lab, SOCE was found to
regulate vesicular release through Ral, a possible mechanism by which SOCE
regulates flight developmentally.
I am also interested in studying if gene expression changes, mediated by
SOCE, are global or have cell-type specific effects. For this, I have
sequenced mRNA from pupal Dopaminergic and Glutamatergic neurons under
conditions of dStim knockdown, two domains where SOCE has been implicated
in flight. Interestingly, we find SOCE to differentially regulate a set of
genes in these two subsets. <br> The Effects of remodeling acto-myosin networks on the
organization of multi-component lipid membrane systems </br><br>The cell plasma membrane is highly intertwined with the
underlying cortical cytoskeleton and membrane-cortex interactions make
this composite a dynamic and mechanically robust platform. The lateral
organization of membrane proteins and lipids depends on many factors
including feedback from their mechanical and chemical environment. To
address these questions, we have developed a reconstituted system based on
supported lipid bilayers and purified proteins. In an earlier study, we
have shown the role of active mechanics, in the form of a remodeling
network of actin filaments and myosin motors, on the lateral organization
of proteins bound to a single component lipid membrane (Koester et al,
PNAS, 2016). Now we turn to more complex, multi-component lipid systems to
ask how active mechanics affects the segregation of lipids into domains
and how relevant this could be in the understanding of processes at the
cell plasma membrane. In close collaboration with the group of Madan Rao,
we also aim to obtain a better understanding of the physical mechanisms by
comparing experimental results with theoretical models. <br> Flies without halteres: Effects of unilateral haltere ablation on
free flight in Diptera </br><br>The hind-wings of flies have evolved into tiny mechanosensory
organs called halteres. During flight, these club-shaped halteres vibrate
in a plane at wing beat frequency. Halteres tend to maintain their plane
of vibration due to rotational inertia. During an aerial maneuver, the
externally imposed alteration of plane of rotation causes Coriolis forces
to act on the haltere knob in a direction orthogonal to its plane of
rotation. The resultant deformation of the haltere shaft is sensed by a
distributed field of campaniform sensors at the base of the halteres,
which then inform the flight control system about aerial maneuvers within
a fraction of a wing stroke. Thus, mechanosensory feedback from halteres
is crucial for stable flight, and ablation of both halteres causes
catastrophic failure of flight. The nature of inputs that the halteres
provide to the flight control system is however not well understood. To
address this question, we conducted unilateral ablations of left or right
halteres, which caused turns in clockwise or anticlockwise direction,
respectively. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that haltere
input constrains the stroke amplitude; loss of input from a haltere causes
the ipsilateral wing to uncontrollably increase amplitude thereby causing
an aerial turn of a specific handedness. This hypothesis, which we are
currently testing, is able to explain many puzzling observations from
previous studies. <br> mGluR Activation and Neurotransmitter Release in the Hippocampusand the mygdala </br><br><p>Synaptic plasticity, or the strengthening and weakening of synapses is a constant process in different regions of the brain, commonly manifesting as long term potentiation (LTP) or long term depression (LTD) of the postsynaptic response. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are one type of receptors that play a role in this plasticity. mGluR has been seen to be involved in LTP in the amygdala and LTD in the hippocampus, two different brain regions. Further studies have shown, that apart from postsynaptic changes, mGluR activation in the hippocampus leads to different presynaptic effects, and alterations in presynaptic vesicle cycling. Previous work in the lab has shown that mGluR activation appears to lead to contrasting presynaptic effects in the amygdala. We wanted to see if mGluR activation has any intrinsic effects on presynaptic vesicle cycling in hippocampal and amygdala neurons. For this purpose, I started learning how to culture neurons of the hippocampus and the amygdala from embryonic and postnatal rat brains. I then started working on imaging vesicle trafficking and release in these neurons. Presently, I have done a few pilot experiments to see the effect of mGluR activation on vesicle cycling in hippocampal neurons, which need to be standardized further.</p> <br> Folding during unfolding of SH3 domain of PI3K </br><br>The study of non-native interactions has become important,
since their role in protein folding is not very well understood. According
to the native centric point of view, only native contacts are formed
during the course of folding. But many interactions, other than those
present in the native state, can be generated in the folding pathway of a
protein, which might have relevance to their biological function. The PI3K
SH3 domain was believed to be a two state folder, but recent studies have
shown the presence of equilibrium as well as kinetic folding
intermediates. During unfolding, the protein is known to encounter a
transient non native burial of Trp53, within dead time of mixing (8 ms),
which is otherwise present in the solvent exposed surface. In my last AWS,
kinetic unfolding of SH3 domain from PI3K in sub millisecond time domain,
to capture the formation of the non native interaction, which could not be
characterized earlier due to limitations in the dead time achieved by
stopped flow mixer, had been discussed. We see an inverse dependence of
apparent unfolding rate constants on denaturant concentration, which being
a characteristic of folding reaction, gives a clear indication of it being
a transient folding like event happening during unfolding of the protein.
In this AWS, I will discuss the characterization of the non native
interactions by mutational analysis; by mutation of the residues suspected
to interact with the transiently buried W53. We find that the residues
being mutated do have a role in formation of the nonnative intermediate. <br> Competitive strategies in phage infections. </br><br>Bacterial viruses, or bacteriophages, play a crucial role in
microbial ecosystems and are considered good systems to ask questions
about decision making, evolution and predator-prey/host-pathogen dynamics.
The lambda phage, infecting the E.coli bacterium is a temperate phage,
which means it can either (i) aggressively exploit the host cell causing
the cell the die in a burst (Lysis), releasing hundreds of phage
particles, or (ii) integrate its genome with the host?s (Lysogeny), also
making it immune to similar future infections. These are called lysogenic
bacteria. This lifestyle choice is implemented by a bistable switch in the
lambda phage genome, which seems to adapt to changing conditions during
the infection. To understand this temperate nature, we model the
competitive infection of an E.coli population by two phage strains,
identical except for their lytic-lysogenic strategies. This infection can
be considered to be a game between two players, i.e. the phages, where
each tries to get the larger share of a finite population of lysogenic
bacteria by using fixed or adaptive lysogenic strategies. <br> The impact of prior experience on resource choice of a generalist
insect </br><br>Food resource choice in insects is a primary determinant of
their fitness. There have been several studies on the factors that affect
resource choice, particularly in plant-eating insects. Most of these have
focused on factors such as host abundance and competition which are
external to the individual. However, there is a scarcity of controlled
studies that measure the innate resource choice of individuals and how
this choice alters after exposure to a novel resource. These measures are
critical to understand how resource choice is shaped under natural
conditions. The model organism I use for my study, Tribolium castaneum,
is a holometabolous, generalist beetle that consumes cereal flours. Using
this model, I manipulated prior experience with resources at an individual
level, across different developmental stages. I observed how that changes
two measures of resource choice - larval resource choice and oviposition
preference. Our data suggests that the larvae show a robust preference for
a resource if exposed to it in a highly resource-specific manner. On the
other hand, exposure to different resources during the early adult stage
does not appear to impact the adult's oviposition behaviour. This
demonstrates stage-specific plasticity associated with resource choice
behaviour, and its potential value in the decision-making of a generalist
insect. <br> Reconstitution of muscle thick filament to study myosin motors in
near native state </br><br>During muscle contraction, the thin filaments (composed of
troponin, tropomyosin and actin) slides past the myosin (thick filaments).
For years, acto-myosin sliding and its biophysical properties have been
studied using single headed muscle myosin motor movement on actin
filaments. However, in the physiological scenario it is the entire thick
filament where many heads act together and generate the forces required
for muscle contraction. The long sought question in this context is the
understanding of the cooperativity of multiple myosin motor heads. To
address this, I aim to take advantage of DNA origami structures that would
provide precise attachment sites for myosin motors, which mimics the
physiological thick filament arrangement.
The technical challenge here is to engineer myosins that can be attached
to DNA. Since the recombinant expression of myosin is non-trivial, we have
devised a strategy that will allow me to take endogenous myosin and
exchange the regulatory light chain (RLC) with the recombinant version
which will facilitate DNA attachment. Until now, I have expressed and
purified RLC-SNAP from E. coli, performed exchange reactions with myosin
fragments and tested its activity. After thorough validation, I plan to
attach these exchanged motors onto the DNA origami structures (which is
being standardized ) and attempt to address questions pertaining to
cooperativity and processivity of myosin. Once this method is established,
it will serve as a universal tool to attach other muscle myosins to DNA
and study their properties. The long term goal is to use this
reconstituted thick filament to study differences in ensemble properties
of alpha and beta cardiac myosins and using this reconstituted system to
uncover mechanisms that regulate fast and slow muscle type myosins. <br> Nucleophilic catalytic-polymer based topical cream alleviates
pesticide-induced toxicity </br><br>Pesticides are extensively used during farming practices in
most of the developing countries including India and China without
adequate protective measures. In India, 80% of the pesticides used are
Organophosphates (OPs) which irreversibly inhibit enzyme Acetylcholine
Esterase (AChE), thus affecting acetylcholine recycling at the neuronal
synapse. OPs-induced toxicity includes slower reaction time, learning
disability, delayed polyneuropathy, anxiety, depression, organic
psychosis, immune-toxicity, maternal toxicity, infertility, and
hypersomnia.
 Agriculture workers are exposed to alarmingly high amounts of OP
pesticides during farm application and handling majorly via dermal
route. We have developed a nucleophilic catalytic polymer which can
deactivate OPs by hydrolysing them before they enter into the skin.
I will be discussing the technology used in developing this cream,
and its effectiveness in vivo. We applied this cream on rats, and
challenged it with more than LD50 dose of OPs (several folds more
than expected exposure during farming practices) to test its
efficiency. <br> Not given </br><br>Not given <br> Dynamics of SUMO upon interaction with SIM (SUMO Interaction Motif). </br><br>Dynamics of biomolecules can be crucial for its function.
Post-translational modifications like SUMO (Small Ubiquitin like
Modifiers) modification can alter the interaction and function of its
target proteins. One mode of interaction between a SUMO-modified protein
and its co-factor is through the non-covalent interactions between SUMO
and SBMs/SIMs (SUMO Binding/Interacting Motifs). SBM/SIMS is
characterized as hxhh or hhxh (h=val/Ile/leu and x=any amino acid)
sequence flanked by acidic amino acids, and in some cases serine residues.
In an interesting fashion, SBM/SIM interaction has been shown to induce
rigidity in SUMO. My present work attempts to understand this altered
dynamics in SUMO using solution NMR spectroscopy. I will be presenting the
experimental results of temperature coefficient experiments and its
implications in the dynamics of SUMO proteins upon binding with SIM
peptides. <br> Changes in translation in amygdala and hippocampus caused by acuteimmobilisation stress </br><br><p>Earlier work from our lab has shown that a single (2 hour) episode of immobilisation stress is capable of inducing long lasting effects in behaviour and synaptic plasticity. Another interesting finding has been the contrasting nature of these changes in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the dorsal hippocampus (dHC). Our current knowledge mainly encompasses immediate effects and effects 10 days after acute immobilisation stress (AIS). Not only, there is no information about the major metabolic changes that are happening in the mature neurons during this 10 day gap but also, there is a lack of information on cell-type specific effects of AIS. Therefore, my initial work has been to build a temporal profile of the translational changes in the BLA and the dHC. For this, I have used a technique called Bio-orthogonal Non-canonical Amino acid Tagging (BONCAT) wherein, I labelled all the newly synthesised protein with an ortholog of methionine and detected it by click chemistry. Further for the cell-type specific information, I have used Fluorescent Non-canonical Amino acid Tagging (FUNCAT) wherein the ortholog was detected by immunofluorescence. In this AWS, I will be talking about my preliminary results on the temporal and cell-specific effects of AIS on mRNA&nbsp;translation.</p> <br> Genetic Interactions among T-Box transcription factors patterning
vertebrate mesoderm along anterior-posterior axis </br><br>Patterning of embryonic tissue along body axis during
development forms the basis for organismal body plan. We are interested in
vertebrate mesoderm germ layer patterning along anterior-posterior axis.
Signaling pathways in concert with the Transcription Factor (TF) network
control axial patterning. Our objective is to unravel the genetic
interactions between three T-Box transcription factors and their role in
compartmentalization of vertebrate mesoderm along Anterior-Posterior (A-P)
axis. T-Box transcription factors are evolutionarily associated with
mesoderm development during gastrulation. Different paralogs of T-Box
transcription factors have been identified in vertebrates. However, three
members of the family, Brachyury (T), Tbx6 and Eomesodermin (Eomes), are
known to be critical for early mesoderm development. Although mutants of
all three genes have apparently similar defects in mesoderm formation,
each mutant also shows defects in distinct mesodermal compartments. We
hypothesize that a common function of these factors is establishing a
pan-mesoderm regulatory program, while the unique functions of individual
factors may, at least in part, underlie mesoderm compartmentalization. My
specific objective is to identify the common and unique functions of these
TFs in vertebrate mesoderm development. Towards this, I plan to identify
the transcriptional targets of Tbx6 and perform a comparative study with
reported targets of T and Eomes. In addition to this correlative study, I
will directly address redundant and specific functions by substituting T
with either Tbx6 or Eomes using mouse genetics approach. I will present
the progress I have made in these directions. Finally, by revealing the
shared as well as unique functions of these factors, our study will shed
light on the as yet unexplored role of these factors in providing distinct
functional identity to mesodermal compartments along the
anterior-posterior axis. <br> Molecular insights into the mechanism of subversion of the host
defense pathways by geminiviral protein C4. </br><br>Geminiviruses are ssDNA plant viruses, belongs to family
Geminivirideae. This is one of the biggest plant virus family, infect a
large range of plant species including many economically important crops
and causes a huge amount of crop lost every year. They contain few coding
gene in the overlapping frame. One of the protein C4 has been reported in
the literature to act as symptom determinant, silencing suppressor in
different Geminiviral species. There is a huge diversity in the C4
sequences that indicate the species-specific role of C4 and also supported
by literature.
 In my study I am trying to find the interacting partner of C4 protein
by which they play their role in symptom development and moderate plant
silencing pathway. I am also interested to study, the biochemical
nature of C4 protein.In this AWS I would be talking about the
construction of binary vector for over-expressing C4 and rising
transgenic plant to find the interacting partner and for localization
study as well as expressing C4 protein in E.coli expression cell line. <br> Elucidating the functions of an autism-related gene in nervous
system development </br><br>The autism susceptibility candidate 2 (AUTS2) gene is
associated with multiple neurological diseases in human, including
intellectual disability and autism. AUTS2 is a highly conserved protein,
primarily expressed in brain. Recently, it was shown that AUTS2 protein
plays a role in transcriptional activation of neuronal genes and it also
promotes neuronal migration and neuritogenesis in the developing brain.
We use zebrafish as a model organism. During evolution teleost genomes
experienced additional round of whole-genome duplication. As a result,
zebrafish genome contains two auts2 genes, auts2a on chromosome 10 and
auts2b on chromosome 15. We cloned both genes and characterized their
expression pattern during zebrafish development. To dissect the functional
role of auts2a and auts2b genes, we induced inherited mutations in both
genes by using transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN)
system. In my presentation I will discuss a current stage of analysis of
zebrafish auts2 mutants. <br> Mixed defences mitigate environmental risk in caterpillar without
affecting fitness traits </br><br>Natural enemies impose strong selection that drives evolution
of constitutive and plastic defences in prey. Theory predicts that
constitutive defences should be negatively associated with plasticity as
it may be too costly to overlay plastic defences on the investments
already made in constitutive defences. We tested whether constitutively
defended caterpillars of Papilio polytes respond to variable environmental
risk via plasticity in larval and adult life history traits and if they
can, does it affects their fitness traits. Caterpillars facing high risk
pupated early. Surprisingly, in spite of shortened larval duration, pupal
and adult body mass were unaffected, suggesting that larvae compensated
for larval duration by increasing resource acquisition to achieve the same
body condition in adult stages as of control individuals. The study
suggests that constitutive defences do not hamper predator-induced
plasticity, rather act synergistically with plasticity. Plastic larval
life history traits may reduce larval mortality while maintaining adult
body condition without facing considerable fitness consequences.
Nyctibatuachus petraues eggs hatch prematurely sensing threatening vibrations
The Western Ghats endemic frog genus Nyctibatrachus lays terrestrial eggs
on overhanging vegetation. The eggs partially develop on land and hatch to
fall into mountain streams where they complete their development. The
large terrestrial eggs are without any protective covering and are exposed
to the environment. Many predators including snakes and wasps predate on
the energy rich eggs and embryos. To escape predation these embryos may
sense specific vibrational cues that are caused during predation to
prematurely hatch and escape into water to reduce mortality. Here, we
determined the hatching competent stage and show that specific vibrations
caused by cat snakes induce premature hatching. This incredible survival
strategy has also evolved in glass frogs from Central America and offers
itself as an excellent example to gain insights on convergent evolution. <br> Investigating the role of Kog1 as a metabolic switch integrating
amino-acid and carbon metabolism. </br><br>Metabolic switches helps cell to sense their environmental
and nutritional status and accordingly switch their metabolic state. One
of the known metabolic switches, TORC1 is the central regulator of cell
growth and metabolism. Kog1/RAPTOR is a conserved essential protein that
acts as a
scaffold to hold TORC1 together, but the roles of Kog1 itself are poorly
studied. We have recently observed that an amino-terminal mutant of Kog1
shows slow adaptation to growth in nutrient limiting condition which is
specifically rescued by Aspartate in a dose-dependent manner. The pathway
that seems to be involved in this process is Gluconeogenesis. The goal of
this work is to understand how Kog1 regulates Gluconeogenesis and
integrates amino-acid and carbon metabolism. <br> Investigating the role of iron uptake in conferring GASP phenotype
to E.coli </br><br>Growth advantage in stationary phase (GASP) is the ability of
cells in long term batch cultures to out compete cells from younger
cultures. One of the mutations that confer this phenotype is a 46 bp
duplication in the stationary phase sigma factor called RpoS. The mutation
leads to decreased catalytic activity of the protein. We wanted to
investigate the effect of this attenuated sigma factor on the
transcription profile of E.coli. RNA seq analysis results show an increase
in expression of genes involved in iron uptake. Hence, I wanted to study
if these genes help in conferring GASP phenotype the RpoS mutant. In my
first AWS I will be showing how despite more than 2.5 fold change increase
in the RNA expression of iron uptake genes in RpoS mutation background,
disrupting these pathways do not affect the growth of the bacteria. We
also show that the strains lacking major iron uptake pathway have no
fitness disadvantage when competing with the RpoS GASP mutants and
maintain their population up to at least 7 days. <br> Genetic program regulating anterior versus posterior mesoderm
formationin vertebrates </br><br>Organization of animal body plan is a result of progressive
patterning of germ layers along the primary body axes. Acquisition of
positional identities along each axis is, thus, a key step to patterning.
Thegenetic programs regulating the position-specific identity remain
poorly understood.Mesoderm (one of the germ layers), in
vertebrates,iscompartmentalized into two suchbroad domains: anterior (AM)
and posterior mesoderm (PM). Notably, these mesodermal subtypes and their
derivatives show many striking differences. Firstly, AM is overtly
unsegmented whereasa part of PM gives rise to segmented epithelial
structures called somites. Secondly, the downstream genetic program
involved in induction of muscle development is divergent for AM andPM. On
the basis of these differences, we hypothesize that the genetic program
regulating AM formation is different from that of PM. To address our
hypothesis, we are assessing the role of key mesoderm factors for AM
versus PM specification. I have tested the requirement of a T-box
transcription factor: Tbx6 for AM specification using muscle development
as read-out for mesoderm development. Previous reports as well as studies
in our lab have shown that Tbx6 mutant mouse embryos showPM defects, while
AM appears unaffected. However,surprisingly, our lineage tracing, along
withTbx6mutant analyses in a genetically sensitized myogenic background
suggestrole ofTbx6in AM. In order to reveal Tbx6 function in AM, we are
analyzing expression of early AM markers in Tbx6 mutant mouse embryos. In
addition, we would analyze AM phenotype inTbx6 mutants sensitized for
early mesoderm development. In future, we aim to understand the
requirement of other such mesoderm specification factors and test the
genetic interactions between them for AM specification. Elucidation of the
genetic program would thus shed light on fundamental understanding of
mesoderm patterning along anterior-posterior axis. <br> Cooperative behavior of processive vs. non-processive motor proteins </br><br>Biological motion ranging from cell division to muscle
contraction is mediated by motor proteins often working as ensembles
rather than as single molecules. Cellular machinery has evolved both
processive and non processive motors which may or may not cooperate with
and among each other for efficient function. In general, processive motors
do not seem to show cooperativity in force generation and velocity while
non processive motors do. However, this is yet to be validated as a
general phenomenon of all molecular motors.
Gliding assays and motor protein ensembles on liposomes, beads, etc. have
been used to study this cooperative behavior, however the control over the
motor number is not possible in these assays which makes them only
qualitative. Here we try to study the cooperativity of a processive motor
kinesin-3 (Kif1a) using DNA origami as a tool which allows to create
number controlled motor ensemble system and study its ensemble level
motility behavior. In future we also plan to study cooperativity in non
processive muscle myosin II using the same tool. <br> Comparative study of the wing hinge mechanics across miniaturized
insects </br><br>Not Given <br> A new toolset for stress tolerance engineering: Heterologous
expression of DJ1/PARK7/HSP31 family proteins confer diverse stress
tolerance in plant </br><br>DJ1/PARK7/HSP31 proteins are members of the DJ-1/ThiJ/PfpI
superfamily whose functions have been poorly understood so far. These
diverse proteins are widely distributed in all kingdoms of life and are
often associated with stress response; however, the biochemical mechanisms
of only a few have been clearly established. PARK7, a human DJ 1 was the
most extensively studied protein in this family that is associated with a
large number of neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson?s disease,
Alzheimer and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Recent reports have demonstrated
that Saccharomyces cerevisiae HSP31, a DJ1 homolog, has
glutathione-independent methylglyoxalase activity and suppresses
methylglyoxal (MG)-mediated toxicity and ROS levels. We hypothesized that
ScHSP31 might confer stress tolerance among plants. In order to test this
hypothesis, we have over-expressed ScHSP31 in tobacco plants. 
Overexpression of HSP31 in tobacco offers striking stress tolerance
against diverse stress inducers such as H2O2, MG, NaCl, CuSO4, PEG and
mannitol. In addition, tobacco plants expressing ScHSP31 contain higher
amount of chlorophyll compared to wild type control plants. In order to
gain insights into the functional relevance of DJ-1 proteins in plants, we
studied DJ1 homologs from model flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana.
Unlike yeast and human DJ1 members, plant DJ-1 superfamily proteins are
pseudo-dimeric proteins composed of a single polypeptide chain. A.
thaliana contains six (DJ1A, DJ1B, DJ1C, DJ1D, DJ1E and DJ1F) close
homologs of animal DJ-1, functions of which are poorly understood. We find
that Arabidopsis DJ1 homologs namely, DJ1C and DJ1D, offer enhanced H2O2
tolerance in yeast HSP31 mutant, significantly to a higher level than
ScHSP31 or human DJ1 complementation. These finding are likely shed light
on the functions of plant DJ1 family proteins and more importantly, offer
novel tools to engineer plants against multiple stresses. <br> Olfaction controls GABA shunt in Drosophila blood cells criticalfor Immune competency </br><br><p>Environmental signaling cues are known to regulate Drosophila hematopoiesis, which forms distinct blood cell types important to safeguard the organism. Intriguingly, lamellocytes are a blood cell type rarely found in the animal but triggered during parasitoid infection or stress scenarios. A clear understanding of the origin and development of this cell type requires further investigation. Recently, our work in the lab has identified the importance of olfactory cues in capacitating the hematopoietic compartment to make required population of lamellocytes upon infection. Further investigation reveals the existence and importance of GABA (Gamma amino butyric acid) shunt, a metabolic pathway, in hematopoiesis for the maintenance of progenitor pool and priming them towards lamellocyte formation. Overall this study aims at uncovering the interplay of neuronal cues and metabolic pathways in capacitating blood cells to mount an effective immune response.</p> <br> Investigating the cause and mechanism of domain swapping in
C-terminal domain of main protease from SARS-CoV. </br><br>Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2003 was
attributed to a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV1. The Main protease
(Mpro) of SARS-CoV is involved in proteolysis of polyproteins encoded by
the virus and is an attractive target for anti-SARS drug design 2. Mpro
consists of a N-terminal domain which is involved in substrate binding and
catalysis and a C-terminal domain (MproC) responsible for dimerization3,4.
C-terminal domain alone can exist as a monomer and a domain swapped
dimer5. Domain swapping in the MproC causes the enzyme to be locked in a
stable octameric form which is active even at low protein concentrations6.
The cause of domain swapping in MproC is not known. Whether the protein
undergoes domain swapping from unfolded state or partially unfolded state
is also not clear7,8.
 The current study aims to investigate the cause of domain swapping for
MproC and propose a mechanism for it using coarse-grained structure-based
model MD simulations. In order to explain the domain swapping observed in
this protein, sequence specific information was also added to the model.
The outcome of this addition will be discussed. The mechanism was
analysed using the simulations of domain swapped crystal structure. <br> In vivo ?milk protein? crystals from Diploptera punctata </br><br>Macromolecular crystals for X-ray diffraction studies are
typically grown in vitro from pure and homogeneous samples; however, there
are examples of protein crystals identified in vivo. Recent developments
in micro-crystallography techniques and the advent of X-ray free-electron
lasers have allowed for the determination of several protein structures
from crystals grown in cellulo. We have determined crystal structures of
heterogeneous milk proteins at atomic resolution (1.2 ?) grown inside a
living organism in their functional niche. These in vivo grown crystals
were isolated from the midgut of an embryo within the only known
viviparous cockroach, Diploptera punctata. The data reveal glycosylated
proteins that adopt a lipocalin fold, bind lipids and organize to form a
tightly packed crystalline lattice. A single crystal is estimated to
contain more than three times the energy of an equivalent mass of dairy
milk; this unique storage form of nourishment for developing embryos
allows access to a constant supply of complete nutrients. Our studies
reveal that the crystallized in vivo milk protein is a heterogenous
population of molecules with respect to the protein sequence and bound
sugars and ligands. Thus, viviparity in D. punctata involves the evolution
of a milk-secreting brood sac and rapid development of embryos able to
drink and importantly, store complete nutrients (protein, carbohydrate and
lipid) concentrated in crystalline form. These data present a unique
example of protein heterogeneity within a single in vivo grown crystal of
natural protein in a native environment at atomic resolution. <br> Serotonin is essential for photoreceptor organ regeneration in
planaria Schmidtea mediterranea. </br><br>Serotonin is most well known as a monoamine neurotransmitter.
Thus it was surprising to find elevated levels of serotonin in stem cell
and early progenitor populations of planaria Schmidtea mediterranea when
compared to differentiated cell populations. Since planaria can survive
months of period without any feed (typically un-characterized liver based
rich feed) and without losing its regeneration ability, it is suited to
study the effect of such small metabolites. Coupled with dsRNAi mediated
knockdown, we find that knockdown of a previously unreported allele of
Tryptophan Hydroxylase (TPH) gene leads to an unexpected photoreceptor
less like phenotype. Presently, further characterization of the same and
the elucidation of the underlying molecular mechanisms for the
observations are under way. <br> Disordered domains of Ataxin2 are required for RNP assembly,
translation regulation and memory. </br><br>Irreversible protein aggregation is the common cause of
neurodegeneration. Several RNA binding proteins (RBP) contain the
disordered regions that lead to protein aggregation and their mutations
have been shown to cause neurodegeneration. The major focus till now has
been to study the process of neurodegeneration. The fundamental question
we choose is to identify the endogenous function of these disordered
regions frequently found on RBPs. To address this, we use Drosophila
Ataxin2 (dAtx2) a RBP, important for LTM and also linked to
Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 2. In silico analysis identified two
intrinsically disordered regions (IDR), one in the middle and another in
the C-terminal portion of dAtx2 protein. We further show the middle IDR
domain of dAtx2 can bind RNA and under go RNA dependent phase transition
in vitro. We find, dAtx2 as an essential protein for fly survival, but the
IDR domains are dispensable. dAtx2 IDR deletions caused a severe reduction
in RNP granule assembly in vitro in S2 cells as well as in the fly brain,
suggesting a specialized functions associated with the IDRs. The Atx2
granules also contain known RNP granule proteins like Me31B and mRNA. The
IDR deletions caused instability in the RNP granule, generating a faster
dynamics, as measured using FRAP. The reduction in number and stability of
the RNP granules directly correlate with the defect in LTM. These LTM
deficiency were not due to developmental defects, as the dAtx2 null clones
in projection neurons showed axonal targeting defects, which was rescued
with wild type as well as the IDR deletion mutants. In summary, we
identify the Atx2 IDRs as the key regulators of RNP granule formation,
which in turn is essential for LTM. <br> Association of prostate cancer susceptibility with non-coding
genetic variation in 8q24 locus </br><br>Recent Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated
non-coding genetic variations in enhancers with various diseases and
cancers suggesting that genetic variations alter enhancer functions and
thereby the expression of the cognate coding genes. However, the mechanism
behind this variation-mediated disruption of enhancer function is not
understood. In this study, we would like to dissect the functional
mechanisms by which the African ancestry specific allele rs72725854 that
predisposes this population to prostate cancer risk. Rare allele
rs72725854 falls in the 8q24.2 locus that harbors several prostate
specific lncRNAs as PCAT1, PCAT2, PRNCR1 as well as the coding gene c-Myc.
ChIP-seq, DHS-seq and Gro-seq analyses identified a strong transcriptional
enhancer harboring rs72725854 in prostate-specific LNCap cells
functionally correlating this enhancer with neighboring lncRNA expression.
 Further, chromatin capture around this enhancer detected physical
interaction between rs72725854 harboring enhancer and lncRNAs PCAT1, PACT2
and PRNCR1 suggesting a direct transcriptional regulation. The risk allele
(A,G>T)leads to a gain of SPDEF transcription factor binding motif which
in turn is strongly implicated in prostrate cancer. Generation of LNCaP 
cells with different alleles of the SNP would help to study the regulation
of the target genes by this enhancer. This study would enable us to
identify the functional roles of SNPs in enhancer regions as well as in
the long term, develop therapeutic approaches to complex diseases that are
driven by such enhanceropathies. <br> The neuronal phosphoprotein Darpp-32 is a marker for principal
neurons in zebrafish </br><br>The response of neurons to upstream stimuli is modulated by
slow synaptic transmission: a network of metabotropic receptors, second
messengers and intracellular signaling cascades. For certain types of
neurons the neuronal phosphoprotein Darpp-32 has been shown to be a
crucial part of this network. We want to explore the physiological role
of Darpp-32 not only in single neurons but in intact neural circuits as
well as its potential role in developing circuits. We chose the zebrafish
as model organism to address these questions. We employed multiple
techniques to first establish a developmental expression profile for
Darpp-32 in zebrafish and subsequently identify the Darpp-32 expressing
neuronal cell types in zebrafish. We found three different isoforms of
Darpp-32 at the mRNA level, two of them throughout the course of
development into adult stages. On the protein level we found Darpp-32
expression in the Purkinje neurons of the developing cerebellum as well
as in the optic tectum. Interestingly the expression of Darpp-32 in the
Purkinje neurons coincides with the differentiation of those neurons (Bae
et al. 2009). We then established the distribution of Darpp-32 protein in
the adult zebrafish brain. Immunofluorescence staining on coronal and
sagittal sections of the adult brain showed Darpp-32 protein expression
in the principal cells of all cerebellum-like structures known in
teleosts additional to the expression in Purkinje neurons. From this data
we conclude, that Darpp-32 is a novel marker for principal neurons in the
cerebellum and cerebellum-like structures in teleosts. Currently we are
in the process of generating a transgenic knock out fish line, where we
are mutating the genomic locus of the different isoforms of Darpp-32 to
eventually have a null mutant fish for the Darpp-32 protein. This
transgenic knock-out line will allow us to probe the function of Darpp-32
in intact neural circuits. <br> How do Individual Honey bees Communicate New Food Source Information? </br><br><p>Honey bee foragers communicate the spatial location of food sources to nest-mates with their unique dance language behaviour. The waggle-dance duration correlates with the distance of the food source from the hive. We asked how fast does an individual bee update her waggle dance duration when a food source is moved to a different location? We trained a natural group of honey bee foragers to an artificial food source. Following the training, we moved the food source to a new distance from the hive without changing its direction. We monitored the foraging and dance activities for individual bees and found that most bees make multiple trips to the feeder to show a change in their waggle dance duration. These results give us the opportunity to further study the underlying events of acquiring and communicating new spatial information in honey bees.</p> <br> Structural and Functional Studies of Eukaryotic Nucleotide Sugar
Transporters </br><br>Nucleotide Sugar Transporters (NSTs) of the SLC35 family (Solute
linked carrier) are essential multi-spanning membrane proteins located in
the Golgi or ER that transport the nucleotide sugars from the cytoplasm to
the Golgi where they get covalently linked to proteins/lipids by
glycosyltransferases. The transport of these sugars is coupled to the
antiport of the corresponding nucleoside monophoshphate (NMP) 1,2 . The
crucial role of the NSTs have been highlighted by a variety of transporter
mutants that lead to severe congenital diseases in humans, to decreased
virulence of parasites and yeast pathogens (Leishmania, and Candida) and
developmental defects in eukaryotic model organisms including C. elegans
andDrosophila 3 . Although there has been great progress in identifying
NSTs and defining their substrate specificity, there is a dearth of
structural information on this class of NSTs to address questions
concerning the transport mechanism of the nucleotide sugars, and molecular
basis of substrate specificity. Furthermore, the necessity of these
transporters in pathogenic microbes makes them attractive pharmacological
target for rational drug design.
The main objective of the study is to have an understanding on how this
class of transporters works at a molecular level. We plan to take a
structural approach and elucidate the three dimensional structure of
nucleotide sugar transporters by x?ray crystallography and use various
biochemical and biophysical techniques to gain insights into the basic
mechanism of substrate recognition and transport dynamics of the NSTs.
This is to understand how they work and as well as for the development of
agonists/antagonists towards this class of proteins.
 Towards this, we have identified and have clones of 26 members of the
SLC35 family from various eukaryotic genomes from the Abramson lab and
Dr. Luis M. Bredeston (University of Buenos Aires).We have carried out
expression tests and detergent screening of several NSTs with reasonable
expression of some of them (NSTs from Giardia, Xenopus and few others) in
yeast. We have also optimized large scale purification of some of the
targets and obtained initial crystals of a fungalNST diffracting to 2.8?.
We are currently optimizing these crystals for phasing and structure
solution.

correlate of fear memory </br><br>Fear is defined as a negative emotion by perceived or imagined
threats and dangers. Animals have two kinds of fear; Innate, which they
are intrinsically born possessing and Acquired, which is based on
experience dependent plasticity over the course of the organism?s
lifetime. Auditory fear conditioning is a type of fear memory paradigm
used to quantify acquired memory, wherein an animal is learnt to pair a
neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) to a noxious unconditioned stimulus
(US), and the animal learns to associate the CS with the US. Mediation
and modulation of fear memory is done by different brain regions,
including but not limited to, the Basolateral Amygdala (BLA), Hippocampus,
and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Studies have shown that
while protein synthesis in the BLA post training is not necessary for
formation of short term memory, long term memory formation is impaired in
the presence of protein synthesis blockers. The Dorsal hippocampus is
involved in formation of memory of context, and blockade of protein
synthesis impairs the formation of the memory of context, while activity
in the ventral hippocampus is necessary for memory retrieval. Thus far,
protein synthesis in the PFC is only known to be involved in formation of
extinction memory. In this presentation, I will be presenting
preliminary work wherein protein synthesis in different brain regions from
the same animal, have been quantified using Non Canonical Amino acid
tagging (NCAT) technique. I will also be discussing the early approaches
of correlating levels of protein synthesis to strength of fear memory. <br> Larval Autophagy and Adult Flight Muscle Development in Drosophila </br><br>Skeletal muscle function is essential for survival and quality
of life among animals. The basis for muscle function lies in units called
sarcomeres. Sarcomeric protein architecture is basis for their contractile
function. Sarcomeres at a very basic level consist of, alternating Actin
rich (Z line) and Myosin rich (M line) discs among other proteins. Their
contraction in concert brings about this motion.
We show that a burst of autophagy (?Self-eating?) in pupal stages of
Drosophila development affects sarcomeric architecture and function in
adult flight muscles. Autophagy, a conserved process to clear
intracellular debris has largely been associated with proteolysis or mass
maintenance in adult muscles. We demonstrate a very muscle specific role
of the autophagy gene, Atg1 in a narrow pupal time window, affecting the
chronologically removed Adult flight muscle sarcomere. A large number of
myopathies are associated with defects in sarcomeric structure. The link
between sarcomere structure and autophagy in development has so far not
been made. Our findings throw open new avenues in these investigations. <br> A silencing suppressor protein Beta C1 from Synedrella yellow vein
begomovirus is an endonuclease with atypical DNA-binding properties. </br><br>Geminiviruses and their satellites have circular single
stranded DNA genomes. To successfully invade new hosts, break host
resistance, move virus particles within and between plants, geminiviruses
and their satellites have evolved a coordinated network of protein
interactions. Recently a 1.3kb Beta-satellite coded protein &#946;C1 was
shown to act as a major pathogenicity determinant in systemic infection
and invasion of host cells.&#946;C1 coded by Beta-satellite of geminivirus
is a 13Kda protein which is mostly localized in the nucleus but has been
also associated with functions in both cytoplasm and
nucleus.&#946;C1protein is a multifunctional protein which is shown to act
as a silencing suppressor, the exact mechanism is not known but it may be
attributed to its affinity towards all forms of nucleic acids thereby
inhibiting host silencing defence pathway. Here we show that Synedrella
yellow vein virus (SYVV) &#946;C1 binds only to ssDNA and some extent to
ssRNA but with far less affinity and does not bind to dsDNA or dsRNA as
previously reported. In our nucleic acid binding experiments we have
observed a previously unreported Mg2+ dependent endonucleases and
exonuclease activity of &#946;C1 on single stranded and circular single
stranded DNA substrates. Further we have identified the DNA binding
property of &#946;C1 protein to the N-terminus 18amino acids and also to a
short C-terminus end of 7aa that are involved in binding to DNA
substrates.
&#946;C1 and many other geminiviral proteins have pleiotropic functions
that are routinely modulated by various post-translational modifications
(PTM). We are exploring a specific PTM called Sumoylation and associated
SIM (Sumo Interacting Motif) interaction of &#946;C1. We have in-silico
characterized the potential Sumoylation and SIM domains of &#946;C1 which
consists of two Sumoylation motifs (one consensus and non-consensus) and
three SIM domains. To understand the nature of SIM domains and their
interactions with SUMO, we are using NMR.NMR analysis indicated that SIM
domain 3(positions 101-105aa) is interacting in-vitro with Arabidopsis
thaliana SUMO1 and Nicotiana benthamiana SUMO and SIM domain2 (90-95aa) is
only interacting with Nicotiana benthamiana SUMO. Further we have
generated &#946;C1 transgenic over-expressing N.tabacum transgenic plants
along with an N-terminal 10aa deletion mutant. These plants will be used
for various assays including immunoprecipitation (IP) to identify
potential silencing and defence related plant proteins. <br> How does stress affect responses to emotionally salient social calls </br><br>Emotions and emotional states of the organism have been
extensively studied in the past few decades. Grossly, the basic emotional
state of an organism can be viewed as comprising of negative (e.g.,
fear) and positive (e.g., anticipation of reward) states. Most of the
models used to study emotional states of the organism are based on learned
responses of the subject, which fail to capture the innate emotional
responses. Also, the cues and conditions employed by the models are not
ethologically relevant. So, in order to address these issues, we are
trying to develop a behavioural paradigm in the lab. To do the same, I
have used playbacks of rat ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) which serve as
ethologically critical social signals and offer a unique window into the
emotional state of the organism. These USVs fall into two different
categories: aversive vocalizations which reflect the negative emotional
state of the emitter, and appetitive vocalizations which reflect the
positive emotional state of the emitter. Additionally, I have been using
the same paradigm to gain insights into effects of chronic immobilization
stress (CIS) on innate responses of the organism as opposed to
conditioned/learned responses which have been studied quite extensively.
In this talk, I will discuss behavioural results from aversive
vocalization playback studies. <br> Probing changes in the prion monomer during protein aggregation </br><br>In vitro protein aggregation reactions are often highly
heterogeneous, depending critically on environmental conditions. It is
therefore not straightforward to derive mechanistic information from a
single probe alone. With this in mind, solution NMR and steady-state FRET
have been used to study the oligomerization mechanism of mouse prion
protein at pH 4 and 150 mM sodium chloride. In the absence of salt,
oligomerization and misfolding does not take place in an experimentally
tractable timescale. Solution NMR, despite being extremely sensitive to
changes in the monomer, is blind to oligomeric species starting from a
dimer, due to size limitations, at least for a protein of this size.
 From our solution NMR data, we conclude that the weak binding of salt at
multiple sites dispersed all over the monomeric protein causes a weak
non-specific perturbation of structure throughout the protein. The only
significant perturbation occurs in the loop between helix 2 and 3 in and
around the partially buried K193-E195 salt bridge. The disruption of this
key electrostatic interaction is the earliest detectable change in the
monomer before any major conformational change occurs and appears to
constitute the trigger for the commencement of misfolding and
oligomerization. Subsequently, the kinetics of monomer loss, due to
oligomerization, was monitored at the individual residue level. The
oligomerization reaction was found to be rate-limited by association and
not conformational change, with an average reaction order of 2.6, across
residues. Not surprisingly, salt accelerated the oligomerization
kinetics, in a non-specific manner, by electrostatic screening of the
highly charged monomers at acidic pH.
 Currently, to probe the intramolecular changes that occur in the monomer
during oligomerization, steady-state FRET experiments are in progress.
Briefly, the kinetics of co-aggregation of a Trp-less mutant and several
single Trp-single Cys mutants (spanning the various secondary structural
elements) of the protein are measured using steady-state FRET. While most
probes traditionally used to follow protein aggregation output an average
rate at which the protein aggregates (and/or changes conformation), our
FRET data suggest that intramolecular conformational changes take place
with variable kinetics, shedding light on the mechanism of prion
oligomerization. <br> Biochemical and functional characterization of RNA dependent RNA
polymerase (RDR) 3 and 4 in Oryza sativa </br><br>RNA silencing is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to
control gene expressions and viral defense in plants. Production of dsRNA
is the trigger for this pathway. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase(RDR)
catalyzes the synthesis of ds RNA that can generate requisite substrate
for Dicer-mediated degradation and for amplification of silencing signal.
There are at least 6 members in plant RDR family. Among these members,
RDR1, RDR2, and RDR6 are well characterized in different plant species.
However, RDR3 and 4 that belong to a unique clade (Gamma), have not been
characterized, mainly because they are pseudogenes in the model plant 
Arabidopsis. However, extensive expression data indicates that in higher
plants with bigger genomes such as rice, RDR3 and RDR4 are expressed very
well. We find that rice RDR3 and RDR4 are expressed tissue-specifically
in rice. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis revealed that rice RDR3 and
RDR4 belong to gamma clade (separate from other RDRs) and have different
conserved motifs as compared to other RDRs. We hypothesize that gamma
clade RDRs have a distinct function and characteristics as compared to
other well known RDRs. OsRDR3 and RDR4 have been cloned in base plasmids. 
Expression of OsRDR3 and OsRDR4 in E. coli, transgenic tobacco, and
transient expression is underway. Both RDRs have multiple
SUMO-interacting motifs. In order to study post-translational sumoylation
modifications of these RDR proteins, we have cloned and expressed AtSUMO
proteins and in the process of identifying RDR-SUMO interactions.
Understanding role of these RDRs, whose function is not known, is critical
to learn about the RNA silencing pathways operating in rice and other
plants with complex genomes <br> Role of E22 in Hippocampal adult neurogenesis </br><br>E2-2, also known as transcription factor 4 (TCF4), is a class
basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription actor, which belongs to the
E-protein family. The E proteins, E2-2, E2A and HEB, bind to an E-box
sequence (CANNTG) and function through homo- or hetero-dimerization with
tissue-specific Class II bHLH transcription factors, thereby regulating
cellular differentiation and development. Interestingly, while all the
E-proteins are highly expressed in developing brain, only E2-2 continues
to be expressed in the adult brain. E2-2 has been shown to interact with
the class II bHLH transcription factors Math1, Ascl1, and neuroD2 which
are known to influence proliferation and differentiation of developing
neurons. The importance of E2-2?s function in the brain is highlighted by
its genetic association to multiple neurodevelopmental and psychiatric
disorders. E2-2 haplo-insufficency causes Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS),
which manifests as developmental delay in mental and motor skills. In
addition, large genome-wide association studies have identified E2-2 as a
high-risk allele for schizophrenia. Preliminary data from our lab show
high expression of E2-2 in the adult brain hippocampus. The subgranular
zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus is one of the two
neurogenic niches where newborn neurons are continually generated during
the lifespan. Hippocampal (SGZ) adult neurogenesis has been implicated in
mood, memory and learning. Preliminary data in our lab using E22 deletion
in neural stem cells in adult mice show significant reduction in immature
neuron population in the hippocampus suggesting E2-2?s role in adult
hippocampal neurogenesis. Following this up, my project is to elucidate
the implication and mechanism of E2-2s function in adult hippocampal
neurogenesis. <br> How does the brain associate events that do not overlap in time </br><br>Animals have the ability to learn causal relationships between
events that are separated in time but repeatedly occur one after the
other. This kind of associative learning is called trace learning. We are
interested to find out the neuronal mechanisms that underlie trace
learning. We attempt to train mice on a trace conditioning paradigm and
then look at the calcium activity of neurons in the CA1 region of the
hippocampus. This part of the brain is imperative for trace learning.
Previous work from the lab has found that trace learning causes cells of
the CA1 region of the hippocampus to converge to a time locked, sequential
firing. Currently we are trying to observe this phenomenon in a chronic
manner by recording from the same animal for multiple days. This will
allow
us to address a lot of interesting questions which i shall discuss.

I shall talk about the chronic preparation protocol that we have
standardized and show some pictures to ascertain the same. Furthermore, i
shall discuss the analysis pipeline that we have developed to analyze the
data. <br> Role of ArabidopsisRAB5 proteins during salt stress </br><br>Proton pumps present on plasma membrane (PM) facilitate the
transport of ions across the membrane via the secondary transporters and
play an important role in maintaining electrochemical gradient. Fusion of
endosomal vesicles to the PM impacts protein composition of the PM and
dynamics of this process influences the ability of cells to respond to
extracellular stimuli. Endosomal vesicle fusion to PM is mediated by two
proteins; the RAB-GTPases and SNARE proteins. The Arabidopsis genome
comprises of 57 RAB-GTPases and one of the families RAB5 is predominantly
localized in the early endosomes and comprises of three members (ARA6,
ARA7 and RHA1).While ARA7 and RHA1 are similar to their mammalian
counterparts and regulate the fusion at the vacuoles. The ARA6 protein is
unique to the plant systems and facilitates transport from the endosomes
to the plasma membrane. All these proteins are activated by a single GEF,
vps9a2. Based on the crucial role of plasma membrane proteins in
maintaining the electrochemical gradient during salt stress and role of
RAB5 proteins in mediating fusion of cargos at the PM; we proposed to
study the role ARA6 during salt stress and characterize the molecular
basis of this phenotype.
We evaluated the K+/Na+ content of WT versus RAB5 Arabidopsis mutants
under salt stress conditions. In the absence of salt stress K levels in
arar6 mutants were found to be lower as compared to WT. Treatment with
100mM NaCl resulted in an increase in the Na+ content making the mutants
more susceptible to salt stress. Measurement of apoplastic pH indicated
that ara6 mutants had a more alkaline pH (under no salt treatment) and the
pH was similar to the (PM-ATPase defective mutant aha1 and aha2).
Alkalinisation of the apoplastic space results in reduced H+-ATPase
activity leading to closure of stomata. Our data with detached leaf shows
that ara6 mutants additionally display reduced water loss when compared to
WT. Our results indicate a possible role for ARA6 in trafficking AHA1/
AHA2 and that a defect in this pathway impacts the other secondary
transporters such as SOS1 leading to a more acute salt sensitive
phenotype. In order to determine the mechanism by which ARA6 may be
involved in trafficking the PM-ATPase pump we plan to check the
localisation of these pumps in RAB5 mutants (using GFP tagged lines) and
additionally do PM-ATPase activity assays. Work related to these is under
progress. <br> Unraveling the sequence of structural events associated with thefolding of single chain monellin protein. </br><br><p>Single chain monellin (MNEI) is a variant of sweet plant protein monellin consisting of 95 amino acid residues. It has one of the 10 most commonprotein folds, ?beta grasp fold?, where the sole helix is packed against beta sheet consisting of 5 beta strands. The thermodynamics and kinetics of (un)folding of MNEI has been extensively characterized in the past decade. As reported earlier, the folding of this protein spans five distinct kinetic phases. However, we don?t yet understand that structurally what is happening in each of the kinetics phases. In this study we are investigating the sequence of structural events accompanying the folding of MNEI by using time-resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (trFRET) as the major methodology. For this purpose, we are monitoring the folding process using a number of FRET pairs spanning different structural parts (such as helix, beta sheet, etc) of the protein using time resolved fluorescence measurements. The equilibrium unfolding data suggests that structural changes accompanying the (un)folding are not two-state in nature. The unfolding of &alpha;-helix occurs through a series of gradual structural changes. However the &beta;-sheet dissolves via a combination of cooperative and gradual structural changes. The double kinetics trFRET data suggests that all the molecules do not collapse within few milliseconds of refolding process, a significant fraction of molecules still remain unfolded like even after 100 ms of refolding. This suggests that collapse is a barrier limited process. This observation has been made across different distances spanning different structural parts of the protein. Also, I shall discuss the sequence of structural events that we can infer based on different kinetics exclusively seen using trFRET.</p> <br> Role of GPI anchor structure in creating liquid ordered domains
in membranes. </br><br>The cell membrane, composed of a myriad of lipids and proteins
the inside of a cell from its external environment. Unlike the passive
Fluid Mosaic Model for the membrane which was suggested by Singer and
Nicholson in 1972, the membrane behaves in most part as an active
composite of the bilayer and the juxtaposed actomyosin network, maintained
away from equilibrium. The activity in this system is also responsible for
much of the lateral heterogenity that is a major feature of the
organization of membrane components. These lateral heterogenieties often
called 'lipid rafts' are regions of the membrane likely to be enriched in
cholesterol, sphingolipids and proteins with either
GPI-(Glycosylphosphatidylinositol) anchor or acylation signals. Over the
years the rafts have been implicated in multiple cellular functions such
as signalling via receptor tyrosine kinases, creating sorting platforms
and modulating membrane protein function. In this study I would like to
address questions about the role of GPI anchor structure, which has been
shown by previous work in the laboratory to be important in nanoclustering
of GPI-anchored proteins. My observations suggest that these nanoclusters
are required for creating liquid ordered domains in cells. In this talk, I
will summarise my approach towards addressing this question and the
progress thereof <br> Dengue virus sequencing: Scientific implications and integration
into public health efforts </br><br>Viruses are the deadliest pathogens which undergo genetic
changes by several mechanisms for their survival by evading host response.
Studying viral genomes has great strength in exploring viral evolution.
For example, every year CDC sequences around 1500 flu viruses to provide
assumptions regarding how flu viruses are related to one another, which
genetic variations cause more-severe disease, or develop resistance to
antiviral drugs, how well a vaccine might protect against a particular
influenza virus, adaptations in influenza viruses circulating in animal
populations that may enable the virus to infect humans etc.
 Dengue is also a viral disease which can be life threatening as
Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever or Dengue Shock Syndrome. India is
estimated to have the highest dengue burden in the world with an
annual economic cost of US$ 1.1 billion. Currently available
treatments are not specific and vaccine is limited to other
countries. The contribution of the dengue virus genome diversity
with the disease is still under explored. Even it is not clear
if viral genome has any link with disease outbreak. This clearly
emphasizes the need of characterizing circulating dengue strains
from India to understand molecular evolution of the virus and
find its correlation with the disease severity or outbreak. In
this study, to sequence the DENV genomes, blood samples
(serum/plasma) from infected patients were collected, viral RNA
was extracted followed by cDNA synthesis. Further DNA libraries
were prepared and Miseq based Next Generation Sequencing was
performed and data was analyzed. The reads mapped to dengue
genome were of good quality and full length dengue genomes could
also be successfully assembled.
 In parallel, we are building an integrated dengue network
including scientists/clinicians from University of Liverpool (Dr.
Chitra P), St. Johns Medical College (Dr. Mary), THSTI (Dr.
Guruprasad), SDUAHER (Dr. Satish Rao), IIHS (Dr. Aromar Ravi),
IISc (Dr. Rahul Roy and Dr. Sai Siva Gorthi), Strand life sciences (Dr.
Vijay Chandru), Manipal University (Dr. Arun Kumar) and IOB
(Dr. Akhilesh Pandey). We have planned to create a digital dengue map to
predict dengue outbreak and characterizing patients in a
better way using viral genome/host based markers.
 Taken together, the information obtained here would definitely
contribute in developing better diagnostics, exploring antiviral
targets, providing clue how dengue outbreak can be stopped,
implementing dengue specific public health measures and for better
clinical management. <br>  Tunable reaction kinetics on the cell membrane </br><br><p>Tunable reaction kinetics on the cell membrane: The cell membrane<br />is a complex mixture of lipids and proteins organized into dynamic<br />heterogeneities of a variety of spatial and temporal scales. These<br />heterogeneities are generated by weak interactions between proteins and<br />lipids, passive and active forces due to the underlying Engagement with<br />dynamic cortical actin cytoskeleton, changes in<br />membrane curvature, and other active processes. It is possible that<br />variation in the surface densities of the proteins and lipids organized in<br />such heterogeneities can modulate the rates of the cellular processes that<br />the components of such heterogeneities are involved in (Chaudhuri et.al.<br />2011, PNAS). Our hypothesis is that the cell can modulate the rates of<br />chemical reactions associated with the membrane by controlling the<br />spatiotemporal dynamics of the&nbsp; cortical actin architecture. I am<br />currently developing an in-vitro,&nbsp; bilayer system on the lines of Koster<br />et.al. (Koster et.al PNAS 2016)<br />where I can modulate the static actin architecture, actomyosin dynamics<br />and bilayer lipid composition to monitor the effect these changes have on<br />the rates of reactions coupled to this system. I will present<br />prelimainary results indicating a role of actin confinement and actin<br />dynamics on collision rates of<br />membrane components, as a first step in understanding the tuning of<br />reaction kinetics in such a system.<br />References:<br /><br />1.

A central aspect of such collective<br />and coordinated motion is their ability to maintain order despite external perturbations, even though mutual interactions between animals may be highly non-linear. To address this question, we have established a behavioral assay in termites of the genus Odontotermes, which self-organize and move in a constant circular pattern when introduced in a circular area. Although the initial orientation of such termites may be quite random, they rapidly reorganize and mill in a circular path along the arena edge at constant rates for long periods of time. How do these termites transition from randomness to order? What sensory cues are involved in this process? In order to answer these questions we first track the termites and measure angular velocity about the center of the arena. This proxy for circular motion of termites increases with time indicating a transition from disorder to order . We proceed to show that time taken to begin milling (circular motion) decreases with increasing number density of termites. We also show that termites continue milling even after the circular arena is removed, and that tracks laid by a previous batch of termites can elicit milling even in heterospecifics. We therefore hypothesize that generic (non-species-specific) chemical trails laid by termites elicit stable group milling behavior.</p> <br> Store Operated Calcium Entry in Human Embryonic Stem Cell Derived
Neural Precursor Cells </br><br>Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) plays a vital role in
cellular calcium signalling and in calcium homeostasis. A plethora of
evidence has set the stage for acceptance of store (ER)dependent calcium
influx through the plasma membrane. In this context the calcium-selective
STIM-ORAI-dependent CRAC (calcium release-activated calcium)current has
been studied widely. Studies in human patients and genetically engineered
mice with loss- or gain-of-function STIM1 and Orai1 genes have revealed
serious functional abnormalities in several systems including the immune
system, musculature, and the skin (1). Accumulating evidence demonstrates
the contribution of STIM and Orai in polarized cells like neurons and
their effect on several neuronal functions and gene transcription (2,3).
 We are currently using human embryonic stem cell (H9) derived
neural precursors (NPCs) to look at SOCE in early neural
development. The small molecule derived NPCs exhibit robust
SOCE which is significantly reduced on stable expression of
ultra-mir shRNA against STIM1 under an inducible TRE3GS
promoter. Assays on proliferation and differentiation
potential of the control and STIM1KD NPCs along with RNA-Seq
analysis to understand the differentially expressed
genes/pathways are underway.

assemblages and shifts in plant trait distributions across climatic,
edaphic and disturbance gradients </br><br>To date a number of studies have been initiated in India, Kenya
and South Africa, these will be briefly outlined. I will then focus on
some of the findings from a study in Kenya which investigates browser
effects on woody defence traits and soils in an East African savanna.
Herbivore exclosures were initially set up in 1999 at three semi-arid
savanna sites with varying rainfall and high herbivore densities at the
Mpala Research Station in Kenya. Several traits relating to plant growth,
leaf quality and defence of the dominant woody species were sampled in
both the control plots and exclosures seventeen years later in 2016.
Significant differences were found for many of the measured plant traits
and soil nutrients when herbivory was excluded. These results will be
presented and discussed. <br> Role of HYL1, a dsRNA binding partner of Dicer like-1, in selecting unique GC signature among plant miRNAs </br><br><p style="text-align:left;">MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small ~21nt long endogenous non-coding RNAsÂ that are involved in post-transcriptional silencing of target mRNAs. miRNAs are processed from precursors having a stem-loop structure that are recognized and cleaved by Dicer-like 1 (DCL1) with the help of dsRNA binding protein Hyponastic leaves 1 (HYL1) and a zinc finger protein named Serrate (SE). Plant miRNA stem-loops are very diverse in length and structure than animal miRNAs, making it harder to define a prototypical model of miRNA processing in plants. There have been few efforts to understand the molecular signatures that affect accuracy and efficiency of miRNA processing. Bulges in the lower stem has been shown to influence precision and efficiency of processing (Song et al., 2010; Werner et al., 2010; Mateos et al., 2010) and the loop length influences miRNA abundance (Jagtap et al., 2014)Â </p>
<p>Â <span style="font-size:14px;">Unlike animal miRNAs, plant miRNAs have unusually high GC content when compared to the average genome. We find that there is high GC content in mature miRNA and miRNA* sequences compared to other regions of miRNA precursors, suggesting a likely selection for GC rich region to make a strong stem. Although genome GC of plants vary across diverse groups, miRNA GC content is almost identical, suggesting a conserved mechanism </span>that selects a specific signature among miRNAs. Our results indicate that HYL1 is responsible for observed GC signature in miRNAs. These results suggest that GC signature is a determinant of plant miRNA biogenesis.</p> <br> How does local cell membrane organisation influence its shape? </br><br>The plasma membrane of the cell delineates the cell from its
environment. Therefore the local shape of the plasma membrane directly
influences the ability of the cell to interact and respond to its
environment. The plasma membrane largely consists of lipids and proteins
that are organised heterogeneously across the surface. Prevalent but
non-exclusive hypotheses evoke lipids, proteins and cytoskeletal proteins
as main players in coordinating this heterogeneity. This coordination can
span both the nanometer to micrometer scales and can be brought about by
active and/or passive mechanisms.
Many experiments with artificial vesicles have shown that the molecular
composition and organisation of a membrane can influence its shape. In
addition, recent experiments in our lab have shown that when a cell is
physically stretched and relaxed back, there is an excess of membrane
surface area that leads to the formation of protrusions on the cell
surface by a completely passive mechanism. This leads to my hypothesis
that the local organisation of molecules in a living cell membrane has a
passive role in the formation of such protrusions. Particularly, whether
shape transition precedes or follows changes in local organization or
chemistry.
To test this, I am currently building an optical tweezer to measure the
membrane tension as a readout of a change in the physical state of the
cell. In the future, I would like to add modalities that will allow me to
impose forces as well as image local membrane organization. With this, I
will be able to check for a correlation between the formation of such
protrusions and the corresponding membrane composition and organisation at
these sites. <br> Efficiently interrogating neural circuits </br><br>Neuroscience continues to witness breathtaking (and
unprecedented) progress in experimental techniques. At the neuronal and
network level, progress has included both the ability to image activity in
as well as to activate/silence specific subsets of neurons in-vivo, in
awake behaving animals. Thus, the prospect of understanding how networks
of neurons mechanistically perform computations that lead to specific
behaviors, seems increasingly within reach.
However, given the dauntingly large numbers of neurons (and synapses)
involved, asking and answering specific questions about aspects of
networks that mediate these computations will require algorithms that
prescribe the smallest (or approximately smallest) number of experiments
necessary (say as a function of the # of neurons in the network). Also, of
interest, are questions about the network, for which one would need a
prohibitively large number of experiments to determine answers; such
questions are therefore de facto out of our reach. This nascent
intersection of Neuroscience and Theoretical Computer Science does not yet
appear to have received attention.
Here, I consider the question of which subset of neurons ?participate? in
producing a behavior and how we can determine this subset efficiently in a
hypothetical experiment. I start by pointing out that the question of what
participation means is not straightforward and discuss the subtleties in
making this notion precise. I then consider a much simpler case, namely
one of deterministic feedforward networks, where I define this notion
precisely. It appears, however, that answering this question may require
exponentially-many experiments in the number of neurons present in the
network. <br> Impact of chromosome organisation on global gene expression and
evolution of Escherichia coli </br><br>Chromosomal replication through a single bidirectional origin
is fundamental to bacterial physiology. Though the origin of replication
is non-obligatory, it is at the center of many important features of the
gene expression and genome organization. We aim to understand its role in
modulating gene expression and genome organization. To address this, we
are perturbing the position of the origin by placing it at different
locations or removing it altogether. These strategies will help us
understand how transcriptional state of a cell is impacted by gene dosage,
chromosome topology and promoter activity.
We have developed strains with two origins at different positions in the
chromosome. We will adress the above mentioned questions by analysing the
transcriptome, genome and genome structure. We will evolve the strains,
under slection for growth rate, to look for strategies adapted to overcome
any defects in growth. <br> An in-vitro approach to understand dynamic actin driven molecular
patterning of plasma membrane components. </br><br>Spatial compartmentalization is an important characteristic of
living cell membranes by virtue of which they function in a specific and
efficient manner. Previous work on cells and in vitro systems has revealed
a role for dynamic acto-myosin in membrane organization, suggesting that
the cell surface, i.e. the plasma membrane connected to a dynamic
acto-myosin network, behaves as an active composite.
Given the complexity of membrane-actin interactions on a living cell
surface, we reconstituted an analogous system in vitro, and showed that
actin and myosin form, upon ATP consumption, dynamic, self-organized
networks, which drive fluctuations of coupled membrane components as
proposed by the active composite cell surface model.
Based on this, we address the question of how cells generate membrane
domains of specific lipid and protein composition. We test the hypothesis
that differential coupling of cell membrane components to acto-myosin
activity provides a possible mechanism. We studied the spatiotemporal
organization of membrane associated actin binding proteins with different
affinities in presence of acto-myosin activity. Our preliminary results
suggest that differential coupling to actomyosin can lead to an active
segregation of the molecules in the membrane. <br> Signal Transduction Through a DNA-Based T Cell Receptor </br><br><p>&nbsp;T cells mount an immune response by measuring the binding<br />strength of its T cell receptor (TCR) for peptide-loaded MHCs (pMHC) on an<br />antigen-presenting cell. How T cells convert the lifetime of the<br />extracellular TCR-pMHC interaction into an intracellular signal remains<br />unknown. Here, we developed a synthetic signaling system in which the<br />extracellular domains of the TCR and pMHC were replaced with short<br />hybridizing strands of DNA. Remarkably, T cells can discriminate between<br />DNA ligands differing by a single base pair. Single molecule imaging<br />reveals that signaling is initiated when single ligand-bound receptors are<br />converted into clusters, a time-dependent process requiring ligands with<br />longer bound times. A computation model reveals that receptor clustering<br />serves a kinetic proofreading function, enabling ligands with longer bound<br />times to have disproportionally greater signaling outputs.These results<br />suggest that spatial reorganization of receptors plays an important role<br />in ligand discrimination in T cell signaling.</p> <br> The Chemistry of Butterfly Wing Pigmentation </br><br><p>Colour, as a trait, is an important sensory cue for inter- as well as intra-species interactions which is shaped by many evolutionary forces. Butterfly wing patterns are no exception to this. The butterfly Papilio polytes exhibits female-limited polymorphism with respect to wing colour patterns. This wing colouration has been conclusively shown to have a mimetic basis but whether these colour patterns also function as intraspecific indicators for mates is not known. The males and nonmimetic females show the presence of a patch of white on the hindwings which, under UV illumination, fluoresce to appear blue. This feature is lost in the mimetic forms of the butterfly. The chemical and biological basis of this fluorescent property and its loss is not well characterized. Previous studies on wing pigments have identified a number of pigment classes implicated in colouration and few that might be responsible for fluorescence. Here, I am using Papilio polytes as the system to study the chemistry behind fluorescence and finally attribute its functionality (if any) through suitable bio-assays.</p>
 <br> Examining Social Choice in Zebrafish *auts2b* mutants </br><br><p>Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) are a group of disorders that are&nbsp;characterized by impaired development and social interaction. Although&nbsp;ASDs could have multiple causes, certain susceptibility candidate genes&nbsp;have been identified, particularly using monozygotic twin studies, such as&nbsp;*Auts2 *(Autism Susceptibility Candidate 2). Zebrafish, being social&nbsp;animals, could potentially serve as models for ASDs. To that end, we have&nbsp;generated zebrafish mutant in the *auts2* homologs &ndash; *auts2a *and&nbsp;*auts2b*. I have been developing a social choice assay to screen for&nbsp;impaired social interactions in adult mutant fish. I will be discussing&nbsp;the assay development and some results that show that the *auts2b* fish do&nbsp;not have an impaired social choice, nor increased anxiety levels.</p> <br>  Generation of Human Hepatocyte-like Cells from Malaria Patient-derived iPSCs for Development of P. vivax Liver-stage Assays </br><br><p>Malaria, a life-threatening disease, is a grave public health<br />
issue. The major challenges in malaria eradication are relapsing malaria<br />
species, due to residual dormant forms of the parasite (Plasmodium vivax)<br />
in the liver, increasing drug resistance, and influence of host genetics<br />
on anti-malarial drug efficacies. To overcome these hurdles, establishment<br />
of in vitro assays of liver-stage malaria for molecular assessment and<br />
drug-testing are crucial. Therefore, in our study, we aim to develop a<br />
robust in vitro liver-stage assay by utilizing malaria patient-derived<br />
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) as a source of donor-specific<br />
hepatocytes that can be readily infected with P. vivax sporozoites,<br />
thereby allowing assessment of host-specific drug responses and<br />
identification of novel targets for therapy. We have successfully<br />
generated iPSCs from the blood of three P. vivax patients and<br />
differentiated them into hepatocytes. Simultaneously, we have established<br />
successful P. vivax sporozoite infection of hepatic cell lines and<br />
embryonic stem cell-derived hepatocytes and are optimizing detection<br />
methods for the same. Furthermore, we aim to develop a liver-stage assay,<br />
which will be validated using standard anti-malarial drugs and then used<br />
to profile compounds for anti-malarial activity. Such a system would be<br />
highly reproducible and cost effective in screening large compound<br />
libraries, and would pave the way towards identification of novel drugs<br />
for relapsing forms of liver-stage malaria.</p>
 <br> Segregation of cell surface molecules driven by cortical actomyosin dynamics </br><br><p>In this presentation of two-parts, I will start discussing<br />
our recent work on phase segregation of passive molecules in an actomyosin<br />
membrane composite(1). The work finds its motivation from several<br />
studies(2,3) showing that a variety of cell surface molecules, e.g.,<br />
GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs), proteins of ras-family (inner-leaflet)<br />
and model transmembrane proteins with actin binding domains (TM-ABDs),<br />
form dynamic nanoclusters driven by actomyosin flows at the cell-cortex.<br />
We now ask whether these different species of molecules, influenced by<br />
actomyosin flows, exhibit a larger scale segregation, depending on their<br />
relative binding affinities to actin. Using an effective coarse-grained<br />
theory(1) which describes the dynamics of localized contractile platforms<br />
or asters, we show that two species of molecules with widely differing<br />
binding affinities to actin, segregate over large scales, even at<br />
temperatures larger than the equilibrium phase segregation temperature of<br />
the binary system. The kinetics of segregation and the statistics of this<br />
actively segregated state, is dramatically different from its equilibrium<br />
counterpart. The kinetics is slow, and shows a breakdown of Porod<br />
behaviour, indicating that the segregated domains have low interfacial<br />
tension. The domains exhibit macroscopic and intermittent fluctuations at<br />
steady state, characteristic of fluctuation dominated phase ordering. At<br />
temperatures below equilibrium ordering, activity results in a breakdown<br />
of large domains. Many of these predictions are being tested by in-vitro<br />
experiments on reconstituted actomyosin systems(4). I will also discuss,<br />
in this context, our recent work on mesoscale segregation of nanoclusters<br />
of GPI-APs and TM-ABDs from our analyses of high resolution FRET-data in<br />
live cells(3).<br />
In the last part I will talk about our ongoing work on an agent-based<br />
Brownian dynamics simulation of actin and myosin filaments on a substrate.<br />
This was motivated in part by the detailed experimental study on the<br />
reconstituted actomyosin system(4). Using the agent-based approach, we are<br />
exploring the phase behavior of the actomyosin system to find out regions<br />
in the parameter space which show formation of experimentally observed<br />
structures(4) like asters and filament bundles. We are working out a phase<br />
diagram as a function of myosin activity, filament length and,<br />
concentrations of actin and myosin.<br />

Abstract &nbsp;Proteins with known structure have been classified into various categories like -&nbsp; domain, family, superfamily, fold and class (Murzin et al., 1995, Sonhammer et al., 1997).<br />
There are many sequences in the sequence database (NR) for whom any structural information is not available; hence, it becomes necessary to identify the sequence homologues for the structural entries. Genomic Distribution of structural Superfamilies (GenDiS) is a repository<br />
developed in the laboratory earlier (Pugalenthi et al, 2005) and comprises of sequence homologues (searched in NR) for structural members at protein superfamily level. Further, it also provides the taxonomic distribution of members and provides information about their complete domain architecture (DA) which refers to the order and composition of domains in a protein.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Domain conservation could mean preservation of function, whereas domain variation can mean that the protein superfamily is associated with diverse functions. In this AWS, I will talk about the methods (Joshi et al., 2014) I have followed to validate the superfamily hits and to extract domain architecture of homologues and comparison of the number of members identified with other databases.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I will also talk about a case study on myosin families for the associated domains and DA. In a previous study in the lab on genome-wide study for myosins, ten novel myosin families were identified (Pasha et al., 2016). I will be discussing my analysis of the associated domains, their taxa-wide occurence, probable functions and the domain architecture for the novel myosin sequences.<br />

 <br>  Investigating the role of Dopamine in Drosophila Hematopoiesis </br><br><p>The lymph gland serves as the hematopoietic organ of Drosophila which forms a stalwart of&nbsp; the organism&amp;rsquo;s innate immune system. It harbours the progenitor and differentiated blood cells, both of&nbsp; which capacitate the animal for mounting an immune response. Various kinds of cues have been elucidated&nbsp; in the past that regulate the maintenance and differentiation of progenitors. This balance between maintenance and differentiation is tightly coordinated during the developmental stages of Drosophila.&nbsp;<br />
Olfaction mediated GABA secretion from the brain is known to regulate the maintenance of the progenitor&nbsp; population. We have, in the lab, recently observed that Dopamine, unlike GABA, is required for the differentiation of progenitors. In my AWS, I will be presenting my preliminary work on how dopamine acts as a cue for driving differentiation with the aim to understand the underlying mechanism.<br />

 <br> The role of compartments and their interactions in intracellular traffic and time keeping </br><br><p>The study aims at understanding the effects of protein compartmentalisation (e.g. into&nbsp; non-membrane bound droplets etc.) and their interactions with cell and lipid membranes. There is not much known about their properties of forming active compartments and the internal molecular dynamics&nbsp; of these compartments. In particular, we focus on &nbsp;Rab-GTPases family of proteins which are involved in&nbsp; cellular trafficking. Their role in mediating the membrane fusions by non-classical approaches makes&nbsp; them an intriguing model system. Rabs&amp;rsquo; activity is mediated by activation of GDP bound state to GTP bound state. We suspect the role of this activity is in changing the micro-environment i.e. &nbsp;by forming&nbsp; active compartments on membranes.</p>
 <br>  FMRP regulates neuronal differentiation via regulating Nonsense mediated decay pathway </br><br><p>&nbsp;Fragile X syndrome caused by the loss of FMRP is a leading<br />
inherited form of intellectual disability. Absence of FMRP affects both<br />
neuronal differentiation and synaptic plasticity, while FMRP acts as a<br />
translation modulator in neuron its molecular function during<br />
differentiation is unknown. Here we report the interaction of FMRP with<br />
UPF-1, the key protein involved in nonsense mediated decay (NMD) pathway.<br />
FMRP regulates UPF-1 expression and NMD function in a cell type specific<br />
manner in human embryonic stem cells (ESC) and neuronal precursor cells<br />
(NPC), which in turn has a differential effect on cell cycle. Using<br />
isogenic Fmr-1KO ESC and FXS patient derived induced pluripotent stem<br />
cells (FXS iPSC), we observe that absence of FMRP leads to increased cell<br />
proliferation and increased G2/M phase in Fmr-1KO ESC/FXS iPSC and<br />
inhibition of NMD brings about the same effect in Cnt ESC/Cnt iPSC. In<br />
contrast, absence of FMRP leads to increased G1 phase in NPC and this<br />
effect can be rescued by inhibition of NMD in Fmr-1KO NPC/FXS NPCi. Hence<br />
we report a novel function of FMRP in regulating the expression and<br />
function of NMD component in human embryonic stem cells through which it<br />
influences cell cycle and neuronal differentiation.</p>
 <br> Genome Wide Survey of Human Tyrosine Phosphatases and update of MOTIFS programme </br><br><p>Phosphorylation is an important switch in cell signalling and<br /> abnormalities in this post-translational modification is implicated in<br /> pathogenesis of diseases like cancer, autoimmune disorders and myotubular<br /> myopathies. Tyrosine phosphatases act antagonistic to kinases, by removing<br /> phosphate from tyrosine residues. Earlier search from the lab in the human<br /> genome provided a glimpse of putative tyrosine phosphatases (Bhaduri and<br /> Sowdhamini, 2003) and some were selected for analysis of<br /> structure-function relationships (Madan et al., 2011). I have recently<br /> revisited the genome wide survey, using a combination of three sequence<br /> search methods (PSI-BLAST, PHI-BLAST and HMMsearch) to search in the<br /> recent version human genome. This has yielded about 190 tyrosine<br /> phosphatases which adopt about 35 unique domain architectures. We plan to<br /> select some of the proteins to analyse their domain architecture for<br /> structure determination and biochemical experiments<br /> &nbsp;</p> <br> The hunt for the doublesex allele in f. romulus </br><br><p>Papilio swallowtail butterflies are models for ecological and<br /> evolutionary studies due to the diversity of mimicry that they exhibit.<br /> Several Papilio (e.g., P. polytes, P. dardanus, and P. glaucus) exhibit<br /> female-limited mimicry. In the species Papilio polytes, three female forms<br /> exist in India, two mimetic (f. romulus and f. stichius resemble toxic<br /> Pachliopta species), and one non-mimetic male-like form (f. cyrus). A<br /> single gene, dsx was shown to regulate wing patterning in P. polytes f.<br /> stichius and f. cyrus, by means of differentially expressed alternately<br /> spliced isoforms. The dsx allele in f. stichius has undergone an inversion<br /> (the dsx allele in f. cyrus is thought to be ancestral), possibly after<br /> the divergence of P. polytes from its relative P. xuthus, which may be<br /> responsible for very low recombination in this region. The geographical<br /> distribution of f.&nbsp; romulus is restricted to the Indian subcontinent and<br /> Sri Lanka and it hasn't been well studied. In this project, I am trying to<br /> study the dsx<br /> allele in f. romulus, whether it plays a role in mimicry, and to carrying<br /> out GWAS to identify loci associated with mimicry in this form.</p> <br>  A Study on Role of Single Neurons as Detectors of Upstream Sequential Network Activity in Hippocampus </br><br><p>Hippocampus is a region in brain which plays a central role in<br />
memory formation, episodic memory, spatial navigation using the convergent<br />
sensory and learned information. Due to its very well characterized<br />
network architecture the hippocampus serves as a very good model to study<br />
network dynamics of memory formation. It is known that the CA1 network is<br />
hierarchically downstream of CA3. We propose that this architecture<br />
enables the CA1 neurons to detect sequential activity in CA3. This means<br />
that an individual neuron in CA1 network can recognize the arrival of<br />
inputs from upstream CA3 neurons in sequence. These sequences have been<br />
experimentally shown to occur during several behavioural tasks like<br />
navigation, trace conditioning etc. To test the hypothesis, we have setup<br />
a light stimulation system which enables us to ontogenetically induce the<br />
activation of neurons expressing channelrhodopsin producing artificial<br />
patterns and sequences of firing in CA3. This will, together with single<br />
neuron patch clamp recordings in CA1, enable us to read the dynamics of<br />
the CA3-CA1 network. With a theoretical model being constructed in lab, we<br />
hope to find and elucidate the mechanisms of episodic memory formation. I<br />
will discuss my research progress and future directions on the project.</p>
 <br> An investigation into the mechanisms underlying regeneration polarity in the planarian species Schmidtea mediterranea. </br><br><p>Planarians are known for their extraordinary regenerative<br />
capabilities. Any wound or even an amputation anywhere along their<br />
anterior-posterior (A- P) axis is capable of regenerating anatomical<br />
structures appropriate to the identity of the missing tissue. In other<br />
words, any given region of the body can be involved in both head or tail<br />
regeneration depending on whether it&#39;s an anterior or posterior facing<br />
wound respectively. This property is called regeneration polarity. in this<br />
regard, we are interested in understanding a fundamentally important<br />
question- What factor(s) decide the regeneration polarity? Current<br />
literature &amp; our data points out to the existence of a &quot;gradient of<br />
materials&quot; in maintaining A-P polarity &amp; it&#39;s resetting for an proper<br />
regenerative outcome Our goal is to identify the nature of this gradient<br />
and the factors that reset it during a regenerative wounding response.</p>
 <br>  Understanding the Homeostatic Mechanisms of PI4P During G-Protein Coupled Receptor Signalling </br><br><p>The transduction of external stimuli via G-protein coupled<br />
receptor (GPCR) signalling pathways is a well-studied process. In the<br />
visual transduction cascade of Drosophila melanogaster, the<br />
light-sensitive GPCR rhodopsin triggers enzyme phospholipase C (PLC),<br />
which hydrolyses the phosphoinositide lipid PI(4,5)P2 to generate second<br />
messengers and propagate the signal. Maintaining PI(4,5)P2 levels during<br />
signalling is vital in order to sustain the response and any regulatory<br />
mechanisms must be capable of keeping pace with the rapid turnover rates<br />
of the lipid during signalling. In Drosophila photoreceptors, the<br />
recycling of PI(4,5)P2 is a multi-step pathway, involving many lipid<br />
intermediates and lipid-modifying enzymes, distributed between two<br />
compartments - the plasma membrane (PM) and the sub-microvillar cisternae<br />
(a smooth ER-derived compartment located below the plasma membrane). The<br />
mechanisms by which PI(4,5)P2 turnover is coordinated between these two<br />
compartments have only been partially elucidated.<br />
<br />
The immediate precursor for PI(4,5)P2 synthesis is another<br />
phosphoinositide - phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P). It has been<br />
reported that regulating PI4P in the plasma membrane of the cell is<br />
important for maintenance of PI(4,5)P2 levels. Recent studies in mammalian<br />
cell lines have reported that maintaining the PM pools of PI4P is<br />
important during GPCR signalling events. PI4KIII&amp;#945;, an enzyme that<br />
synthesises PI4P, has been shown to transiently localise to the PM in<br />
complex with two other proteins. Experiments involving the downregulation<br />
of PI4KIII&amp;#945; and its interacting partners in Drosophila photoreceptors<br />
show a reduced response to light, as measured by&nbsp; lectroretinograms. Such<br />
manipulations also show an overall reduction in PI(4,5)P2 levels as<br />
measured using lipid-binding probes, along with altered kinetics of<br />
PI(4,5)P2 recovery upon stimulation with light. In my AWS, I will<br />
elaborate upon further experiments conducted in this vein and the results<br />
obtained therein.</p>
 <br> Understanding diversification in the Asian tropical forests: a case study of swallowtail butterflies. </br><br><p>One of the main endeavours of evolutionary biologists has been<br />
to understand the origins of biological diversity. The recent advances in<br />
the field of the molecular phylogenetics and historical biogeography has<br />
now provided new quantitative tools to study&nbsp; speciation and<br />
diversification patterns and processes. In this talk, I will explore<br />
diversification among<br />
<br />
Papilio (subgenus: Menelaides )<br />
butterflies in the tropical forests of the South and Southeast Asia. To<br />
this end, I have integrated the evidence from multiple lines including DNA<br />
sequences, morphological traits, and data from geology, climate, and<br />
ecology. I found that<br />
<br />
Menelaides<br />
&nbsp;butterflies have speciated largely in mid-Miocene in allopatry in the<br />
South and Southeast Asia due to repeated dispersals across key<br />
biogeographic barriers. The diversification within each subregion<br />
happened at different time periods and was influenced by multiple<br />
geo-climatic processes. These butterflies also exhibited large<br />
morphological variation in their wing patterns and participate in<br />
mimicry, which is thought to be an ecological adaptation. However, I<br />
didn&rsquo;t find any significant effect of mimicry evolution on the<br />
diversification rates within this radiation, suggesting local population<br />
level factors may be more important in maintaining the mimicry. The<br />
framework developed during the course of research promise to benefit<br />
future systematic, speciation and diversification studies in the tropical<br />
forests on a wide range of taxa.</p>
 <br> Adaptive modulation of swimming in larval zebrafish in a virtual environment </br><br><p>Zebrafish larvae exhibit an innate behavioral response, where<br />
they stabilize themselves against involuntary motion caused by flowing<br />
water.&nbsp; This response can be evoked reliably using visual stimuli that<br />
drift one way or the other, across a wide field of view, to simulate flow<br />
(optomotor response).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;To study the neural control of this behavior, I have developed a virtual<br />
environment for restrained zebrafish larvae to perform the optomotor<br />
response and receive realistic sensory feedback&nbsp; corresponding to any<br />
movement they make. This setup allows me to manipulate how motor output<br />
of the fish maps to the corresponding sensory feedback (feedback gain) and<br />
record activity in brain regions of interest during the behavior.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Here, I will present some results from behavioral experiments where I<br />
manipulate feedback gain of the virtual environment. In these<br />
experiments, the fish compensate their motor output to adjust for errors<br />
introduced by the unexpected gain change.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Using this behavior setup integrated with a custom built two-photon<br />
microscope, I have recorded visual stimulus evoked activity in Purkinje<br />
cells in the larval zebrafish cerebellum, using a genetically encoded<br />
fluorescent indicator of neuronal activity. In future experiments, I plan<br />
to manipulate feedback gain while imaging brain activity to gain insights<br />
into sensorimotor control of this behavior.</p>
 <br>  Understanding the mechanistic basis for detection of a universal insecticide </br><br><p>Insects depend on chemical cues for survival and for interacting<br />
with their environment (to locate food, mates etc.). We have recently<br />
identified a plant-derived compound from an Indian medicinal plant that<br />
serves as a broad spectrum fumigant insecticide across several insect<br />
orders. Electrophysiological experiments revealed that several diverse<br />
insect species can detect this compound through olfaction. Our goal is to<br />
determine the mechanistic basis of the olfactory detection of this<br />
compound, and understand its role in the ecology and evolution of insects.<br />
The remarkable conservation of identification across millions of years<br />
suggests genotypic or phenotypic constraints on the perception and/or<br />
toxicity of the molecule. We are currently using various approaches such<br />
as toxicology and behavioral bio-assays of several species, neurogenetics,<br />
and electrophysiology to confirm molecular mode of action and identify<br />
potential constraints on insect response.</p>
 <br> Stabilization Induced Reduction in cooperativity of Protein Folding </br><br><p>Highly cooperative folding of small globular proteins (two-state<br />folders) imposed a view that cooperativity is an inherent property of<br />polypeptide chains and one invariant transition state separates the folded<br />state from the unfolded state. However, the &ldquo;new view&rdquo; of funnel-shaped<br />energy landscape of protein folding predicts that folded state samples<br />many open conformations en-route to the unfolding. Further to that,<br />cooperativity of unfolding is sensitive to solvent conditions. In order to<br />understand how a change in solvent conditions affect the cooperativity of<br />the unfolding, native state hydrogen exchange (HX) of the SH3 domain of<br />PI3 kinase (PI3K SH3) was carried out under increasing stabilizing<br />conditions. At native condition, PI3K SH3 unfolds cooperatively while<br />trimethyl amine N-oxide (TMAO) induced stabilization reduces the<br />cooperativity of the unfolding (opening). Our study suggests that change<br />in stability of protein lead to modulation of cooperativity of unfolding<br />and thereby resulting in a change in energy landscape from a barrier<br />limited (highly cooperative) to a barrier-less (non-cooperative).</p> <br> Genotyping SNPs from non-invasive samples: new technology for tiger conservation </br><br><p>Tigers have experienced a dramatic range contraction in the recent past and currently occupy a mere 7% of their historical range. Genetic tools can be used to effectively monitor wild species of conservation concern such as tigers. Such approaches allow us to identify individuals, reconstruct relatedness between them and monitor connectivity between populations. Microsatellite markers are currently used across many laboratories to study tiger populations. However, non-invasive samples obtained from tiger feces continue to present challenges such as high error rates and low genotyping success for microsatellite markers.</p>
<p>In my previous AWS, I spoke about using a ddRAD seq approach to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from tiger tissue samples to study population connectivity across India. In this study, we developed a panel of SNP markers for use with fecal samples of wild tigers. Primer design was outsourced to a company that specializes in human genetics. Multiplex PCR with the primers followed by Illumina sequencing of pooled, barcoded amplicons allowed fast implementation of the protocol. A total of 339 SNPs were targeted and amplified in short fragments of 40 base pairs. We tested the method on fecal samples of captive tigers of different ancestry and varying DNA concentrations. All samples were run in triplicate to investigate error. Results revealed that many samples with very low starting amount of target DNA (&lt; 1ng) had high genotyping success (between 0.75 and 1).The observed probability of identity (the probability of obtaining the same genotype for different individuals) was found to be very low (PID = 2.4E-84, PID sibs = 4.4E-44). Replicate genotypes of the same sample were highly similar with rare occurrence of mismatches. No difference was observed in the success rate for tigers of different ancestry. We are now going to test the protocol on fecal samples collected from the wild.</p> <br> Systematics of Indian Butterflies: elucidating evolutionary patterns </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Systematics is the study of diversification and interrelationships among life forms. Taxonomic impediment in the estimation of biodiversity is a major problem in the current scenario of continuous extinction biodiversity. In order to implement appropriate conservation strategies importance of systematic studies is realized oflate. From the time of Linnaeus in late 1700s, approaches to systematics have continuously been updated from morpho-taxonomy to phylogenetics. Modern integrated approach empowers systematics to depict the underlying evolutionary patterns of diverse life forms at a greater resolution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Butterflies, as a group of insects, show astounding diversity. Large variations in phenotypic characters made them a model system to reveal interesting evolutionary patterns. In India, the field of butterfly systematics has been pioneered by several eminent naturalists. These earlier taxonomic studies relied on morphological characters with less phylo-geographical understandings and require major updating. Thus, an integrated approach is needed to delineate species more accurately and elucidate diversification patterns in Indian butterflies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this scenario, I will study morphological characters, namely variation in genitalia morphology and wing shape to understand diversification patterns across species. External genitalia morphology has been used to delimit species in earlier studies as a proxy for reproductive isolation. In this AWS, I will talk about the variations in butterfly genitalia morphology and implementation of this morphological character in revising Tarucus and Halpe group of butterflies from India. Secondly, I will explain an estimation of wing shape variation in relation to taxonomical problems in Calinaga. Based on these patterns, I will also describe my future goals to explain species diversification and evolution of morphologically diverse traits in the Indian landscape in a spatio-temporal manner.</p> <br> THE TALE OF TWO SYNAPSES: A STUDY IN ZEBRAFISH PURKINJE NEURONS </br><br><p>In the past two decades, there has been a surge of studies trying to decipher the rules governing synapse formation. A major hypothesis in the field is that &ldquo;gap junctions (GJs) direct chemical synapse formation&rdquo; fuelled by the observation that GJs appear prior to chemical synapses. I am using live imaging Purkinje neurons (PNs) in zebrafish as a model system to determine if the hypothesis holds true. Gap junctions are composed of Connexin protein subunits (Cx), with Cx35 being a widespread gap junction protein in zebrafish CNS. In this AWS, I will present results indicating that electrical synapses might act as nodes for dendritic stabilization and thus as anchors for chemical synaptic molecules to assemble and form functional contacts.</p>
<p>Daily imaging of PNs shows a consistent increase of total dendritic length and total dendritic branch number (TDBL and TDBN, respectively) from 5-7 days post fertilization (dpf). This growth was hampered in Cx35-/- fish with significant decrease in TDBL observed at 7dpf, as compared to wildtype neurons. Hourly imaging at 6dpf showed that PNs in wildtype and Cx35-/- groups added similar amounts of dendritic lengths but the neurons of Cx35-/- fish have significantly higher retraction rates. This suggests that electrical synapses might act as stabilizing contacts between neuronal processes and prevent their retraction beyond the junction. This serves as a bridge between the observations of chemical synapses stabilizing dendritic and axonal arbors and the idea of Cx35 encoded gap junctions guiding chemical synapses. Further experiments involving live imaging of PN arbors and overexpressed electrical and chemical synapses will help to determine the exact dynamics of their formation.</p> <br>  Responses of descending interneurons to mechanical and visual stimuli in Oleander hawk moths  </br><br><p>Sensory feedback is necessary for flight in insects. In hawk<br />moths, mechanosensory input from antenna has been shown to be crucial for normal flight, in addition to visual feedback during flight.<br />However, the neural pathways that process and transmit the antennal<br />mechanosensory and visual information to the flight motor system are not known. Because this information must be acquired and processed in rapid timescales on the order of single wing strokes, it is expected that the information is collated by a sparse network including perhaps single neurons that combine information from both eyes and antennal<br />mechanosensors. In my project, I aim to identify such neurons by<br />recording intracellularly the responses of descending intreneurons in<br />ventral nerve cord of the oleander hawk moth [_Daphnis nerii_].</p>
<p><br />In my last AWS, I had talked about development and characterization of tools and methods necessary for this project. In this AWS I will present data which is being collected from this setup, plans for analysis and future work.</p> <br> Patterns of single nucleotide changes under selection  </br><br><p>Mutations are the primary source of genetic variation within<br />a population, and hence the substrate on which natural selection acts.<br />Single nucleotide changes are the most common form of mutations. With the advent of cheaper sequencing, it has become possible to look at such genetic changes in organisms while they are evolving (experimental evolution). In the past few years, there have been many such experimental evolution studies on microbes, quantifying the fitness effects of single nucleotide changes on the fitness of organisms<br />evolving under strong selection.</p>
<p><br />In our study we aimed to determine whether there are underlying patterns in the nucleotide changes seen in these experimental studies. Analyzing these patterns can help us answer fundamental questions in molecular evolution. For instance,do different types of mutations (AT?GC, or GC?AT mutations being one such type) occur equally under selection or are different than those observed under neutral or very weak selection? Or are some nucleotide changes more or less beneficial depending upon the kind of stress the organism faces? I shall be talking about some results that we find from our preliminary analyses.</p>
<p>I shall also be talking about my future work plans with Triboliumcasteneum in which I plan to look at the effect of migration on<br />populations adapting to a novel dietary resource.</p> <br> Bioenergetics of Synaptic Translation </br><br><p>A hallmark of long-term plasticity is to alter de-novo protein synthesis. mGluRs and NMDARs are two glutamate receptors having important role in synaptic plasticity. Interestingly on stimulation these receptors show a contrasting impact on global protein synthesis at the synapse. In our study we found that, mGluR leads to a decrease in phosphorylation of eEF2 hence activating translation whereas NMDAR doing the reverse. Interestingly they both activate ERK pathway indicating the contrast begins at a much downstream point. The mechanisms by which they achieve such contrast though, are largely unknown. Here we have investigated the activity mediated change in ATP levels both as a cause and effect of the translation regulation at the synapse. Stimulation of mGluR also leads to a protein-synthesis dependent decrease in synaptic ATP level which recovers to its basal level within few minutes. In contrast NMDAR shows no such changes in ATP level at least immediately after stimulation. Since the protein synthesis and ATP dynamics are linked intricately, we are investigating how the contrasting effect of mGluR and NMDAR on this process may have an impact on synaptic function.</p> <br> Antagonistic Pleiotropy under Genetic Drift </br><br><p>Negative correlations between traits, or tradeoffs, may constrain trait evolution. Tradeoffs in microbial resource utilization shape ecological and biogeochemical processes. True tradeoffs stem from antagonistic pleiotropy (AP), when mutations are simultaneously beneficial for one trait and deleterious for another. Demonstrating functional tradeoffs is difficult as strong selection on a trait allows unrelated genes to accumulate deleterious mutations, leading to erosion of those traits and causing spurious negative correlations across traits. To get accurate, unbiased estimates of the incidence of AP, we evolved replicate lines of Escherichia coli strains with varying ~2000-fold in mutation rates under minimal selection (mutation accumulation) for hundreds of generations. In this regime, populations evolved mainly under genetic drift. Evolved populations had 1&ndash;130 point mutations accumulated per line. We measured growth rate of each evolved line on different carbon sources to find instances of AP (increased growth on resource A and decreased growth on resource B). Across pairwise comparisons of resources, the proportion of replicate lines showing AP varied from 8% to 46%. Surprisingly, incidence of AP decreased with higher mutation rate and but shows no relationship with metabolic dissimilarity between two resources. Our study is the first to systematically quantify the incidence of functional AP and factors influencing it. Our work highlights the inherent variability and context dependence of AP, and suggests that evolution under genetic drift is a powerful method to reveal these patterns.</p> <br> Elongation of tau fibrils follows Michaelis-Menten like enzyme kinetics </br><br><p>Amyloid fibrils have been associated with many neurodegenerative diseases. Amyloid fibril formation reaction follows a nucleation dependent polymerization model in which most of the monomers converts into the fibrils during the elongation phase. During this phase, extension of fibrils take places via the addition of monomeric proteins onto the ends of existing fibrils. In this study the process of tau fibril elongation has shown to follow a Michaelis-Menten like enzyme kinetics model in which preformed fibrils play the role of an enzyme which converts the free intrinsically disordered monomer (substrate) into its bound amyloid form (&beta;-sheet rich). Here we show that fibril elongation process is &nbsp;a minimal two-step process in which first monomer protein binds to the end of existing fibrils and then conformational conversion step takes place. Modeling the fibril elongation process to a simple Michaelis-Menten like enzyme kinetics model may provide better understanding at quantitative level how mutations, post translation modification and ligand binding modulate the aggregation process.</p> <br> Phospholipase D regulates membrane turnover in Drosophila </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">The plasma membrane of cells undergo continuous turnover with consequent changes in receptor composition and cellular function. A balance of endocytosis and the delivery of new membrane is a key factor in maintaining membrane composition and cellular homeostasis and yet, the coupling between these events remains unclear.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The light sensitive apical plasma membrane of <em>Drosophila</em> photoreceptors (rhabdomere) undergo rapid turnover during illumination resulting in changes in rhabdomere size.The change in rhabdomere volume is accompanied by changes in the level and localization of apical membrane protein rhodopsin1. We find that photoreceptors contain a light induced phospholipase D (dPLD) activity. In this AWS, I will present evidences which suggest that during illumination, dPLD function regulates membrane turnover in an ARF1 and retromer complex dependent manner thereby aiding recycling of rhodopsin containing membrane to the plasma membrane.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our studies in <em>Drosophila</em> photoreceptors implicate dPLD as a regulator of &nbsp;apical membrane recycling in polarized cells. We are interested to understand whether dPLD is a general regulator of membrane recycling. To test this, we are studying the function of dPLD in the synapse of <em>Drosophila</em> larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ). I will present some preliminary evidence suggesting&nbsp; dPLD function is required for neuronal vesicle recycling. Besides, we also found dPLD&nbsp; is required to maintain boton number in the NMJ.</p> <br> Altered dynamics of mouse prion protein during salt induced oligomerization </br><br><p>Proper folded structure of a protein is crucial to carry its biological function(s) and hence maintain living systems. It is well known that several proteins upon misfolding cause fatal diseases. Prion is one such protein which upon aggregation causes fatal neurodegenerative diseases like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Fatal Familial Insomnia (FFI), Kuru etc. which have no cure. In order to discover therapeutic targets it is important to study how the conversion of the monomeric protein to oligomer(s) happens. The mouse prion protein (moPrP) is &alpha;-helical at pH 4 in absence of salt. Upon addition of 150mM NaCl at pH and 37C it oligomerizes to a &beta;-sheet rich structure.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&nbsp;have studied the effect of salt and temperature variations on the native (monomeric) structure by solution Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. These results suggest that NaCl binds weakly to moPrP, resulting in loss of vital interactions destabilizing the protein. Also the unstructured N-terminus of the protein shows increased conformational flexibility upon addition of salt.</p> <br> Role of FMRFaR signaling in dopaminergic neurons for regulation of flight in Drosophila melanogaster </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Calcium is synonymous with a wide variety of cellular processes such as gene transcription, signal transduction, neural excitability etc., which could all potentially impact animal behaviour. Two key molecules of interest in calcium signaling are the endoplasmic reticulum resident calcium channel, namely, inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) and the ER calcium store depletion sensor, namely, stromal-interacting molecule (STIM). A number of extracellular stimuli that activate GPCRs can lead to the rapid release of calcium from ER stores, via the IP3R. Subsequently, store depletion is sensed by STIM, which then oligomerize and appose against the ER-PM junctions to facilitate ORAI channel formation. It is through these channels that calcium from the extracellular milieu enters the cytoplasm, a process known as store-operated calcium entry, SOCE. In <em>Drosophila</em>, pan neuronal down regulation of SOCE components leads to flight deficits. More specifically, work is the lab has shown that reduced SOCE in dopaminergic neurons results in flight defects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In parallel, a hunt for genes, specifically G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) functioning upsteam of this pathway in the context of flight lead to the discovery of a neuropeptide receptor, namely, FMRFaR. In this AWS, I will be presenting data describing the role of FMRFaR in a specific set of dopaminergic neurons for regulation of acute flight.&nbsp;</p> <br> Receptor Clustering and Ligand Recognition </br><br><p>Receptor proteins resident on the cell surface are involving in reading, processing and transducing extracellular information into an intracellular response; they are often observed to cluster together in the process. The various mechanisms by which these receptors function efficiently and remain robust to error are of general interest. Here we analyse an analytically tractable yet experimentally relevant model of receptor clusters, characterising its response when presented with ligands of varying abundances and affinities. We find that such a cluster implements efficient kinetic proofreading by exploiting the dynamics of spatial organisation (i.e. clustering), which we term dynamical proofreading. We demonstrate that this proofreading scheme is capable of supporting multiple kinetic regimes, in which a 'correct' ligand may rapidly induce activation while an 'incorrect' ligand takes hours to do so. We present our results in conjunction with a recent quantitative study of T-cell antigen discrimination, and discuss their implications.</p> <br> SUMO Interacting Motifs Facilitate Auto-SUMOylation of HCMV Immediate Early Proteins </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">SUMO is a Ubiquitin like post translational modifier that modulates target protein stability, localization, catalytic activity and its interactome. SUMO gets covalently attached to its targets via an enzymatic cascade of reactions like ubiquitin. Recent studies have shown that Viruses hijack several cellular pathways, including SUMOylation, for its effective replication and propagation. Here, we study the mechanism of how immediate early proteins of Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) interact and interrupt host SUMOylation pathway. HCMV- IE2 is an essential immediate early protein whose phosphorylation and Sumoylation has been reported by in-vivo studies. Abrogating IE2 SUMOylation decreases viral replication. Therefore, it is discernible how an exogenous viral protein uses endogenous SUMOylation pathway to SUMOylate itself for functional advantages. Interestingly, IE2 has a SUMO Interacting Motif (SIM) along with SUMOylation site adjacent to each other. Our results suggest that presence of SIM in IE2 enhances its SUMOylation. We also found that phosphorylation of IE2 SIM increases its SUMO binding affinity by several folds. We plan to explore how SIM phosphorylation affects IE2 SUMOylation in future.</p> <br> Phenotypic and Genotypic characterisation of evolving population of Escherichia coli in Prolonged stationary phase </br><br><p>In comparision to the routine growth of lab strains in rich media like luria broth, Bacteria in nature mostly adapt a feast-or-famine lifestyle with high competition from species sharing the same niche.(Zinser,1999).</p>
<p>After the regular lag , log and stationary growth phases of bacteria, incubation of the same without addition of new nutrients leads to a phase where net bacterial population remains constant but genetic landscape of the population remains actively dynamic. This phase is called prolonged stationary phase.</p>
<p>In order to probe the evolution of bacteria under natural conditions bacteria were evolved under prolonged stationary phase and we see increased phenotypic and genetic diversity in prolonged stationary phase. I will be elaborating on one phenotypic variant called "Small Colony variant"(SCV) which emerged in prolonged stationary phase. Initial characterization of the Small colony variant has been done form phenotypic and genetic perspectives. I pose the long-term question here : How are small colony variants Small and whether Small colony size has any fitness advantage to adapt to complex prolonged stationary phase stress.&nbsp;</p> <br> Cellular and molecular heterogeneity of fibroblast responses in mouse model of dermal fibrosis  </br><br><p>Fibrosis can be thought of as an overscarring wound, where excessive production of extracellular matrix leads to tissue hardening and loss of organ function. The key cellular mechanism in both scarring and the pathogeneses of fibrosis is activation of the fibroblast. However, this raises an interesting puzzle of whether the same fibroblast performs all of the processes that fall under the umbrella term of &ldquo;activation&rdquo; or are there sub-populations of fibroblasts performing specific functions that are under different regulatory controls. Our lab uses a Snail transgenic (Snail Tg) mouse model of dermal fibrosis to probe this question. Using this model, we have identified a protein exclusively secreted in Snail Tg skin, Mindin which causes both fibroblast migration and contraction. Our data suggests that Mindin specifically causes migration of the reticular sub-population of fibroblasts, while the papillary fibroblast are the ones that contract. Also, we found that Mindin mediates migration via Fyn kinase but contraction is mediated by Src. We are currently trying to understand the differences between these subsets of fibroblasts in terms of Src kinase expression and recruitment which might explain their distinct responses. Overall this work would lead to better mechanistic understanding of fibroblast heterogeneity and its role in fibrosis.</p> <br> Convergence of Mechanical Cues and Epigenetic Regulation at the Initiation of the Wound-healing Response </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">The wound-healing program is a complex biological process, where effective communications between numerous cell types are necessary. &nbsp;In spite of decades of research on wound-healing, basic questions such as &ldquo;how do cells sense the injury?&rdquo; and &ldquo;what are the downstream wound-response pathways?&rdquo; remain elusive. Previous lab studies have established downregulation of caspase-8 as a physiological response to cutaneous injury. The significance of caspase-8 downregulation could be understood by the fact that failure in this process leads to perturbed wound-healing, as observed in diabetic wounds. Our observations led us to inquire about the mechanisms inducing the wound-response, using caspase-8 downregulation as a cellular reporter of this phenomenon. My results so far suggest that changes in intra- and intercellular mechanical force act as an important early wound signal. Interestingly, this signal leads to the hypermethylation of caspase-8 promoter, a potential mechanism for gene downregulation in wounded cells. The advances in the epigenetics field have demonstrated how the modulation in DNA methylations contribute to the gene expression in both chronic physiological and pathological conditions. However, this is a rare phenomenon where epigenetic pathways regulate acute physiological responses, such as wound-healing. Here we show that the changes in cellular tension stimulates DNA methyltransferase 3a (DNMT3a)&rsquo;s nuclear localization and increased its occupancy at the caspase-8 promoter. Our study links the changes in physical forces with the activation of the epigenetic machinery and further opens up an avenue to discover the regulator of epigenetic machinery.</p> <br> Not available </br><br><p>Not available.</p> <br> How cells survive freezing: A physical perspective </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">How do the intrinsic physical properties of the cytoplasm facilitate survival of cells during freezing and thawing? Not all organisms can survive (i.e. restore normal structure and function) complete freezing and thawing of their bodies. Many freeze-thaw tolerant organisms produce molecules that can facilitate the liquid cytoplasm to transition to a glassy state, which is speculated to aid in their survival upon thawing. Indeed, glassiness of the cytoplasm is a recurrent feature in many organisms which aids in their survival in stressful conditions. Under normal conditions, the cytoplasm is known to be an active liquid fluidized by the various forces generated inside the cell. [1,2] We study the factors that govern the active liquid&ndash;glass transition of the cytoplasm during freezing and the glass&ndash;active liquid re-entry upon thawing. In particular, we aim to understand how these transitions are set by physical parameters (temperature, cooling rate, thawing rate) and to what extent they are affected by the active regulation of the biochemical state of the cell.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Experiments to understand these transitions require the ability for cells to be tolerant to freezing and thawing over a wide range of physical parameters. Yeast cells are known to utilize enhanced Trehalose (glass forming molecule) production in response to freezing under certain physical parameters. Currently, we have evolved yeast cells with enhanced freeze-thaw survival abilities which show increased basal levels of Trehalose. Currently, we are setting up experiments using microrheology techniques to measure the physical properties of the cytoplasm of these evolved cells during the freeze thaw process.</p>

Chemical or genetic screens are very powerful methods to identify these regulators. While most screens have successfully identified negative regulators, very few screens have identified and validated positive regulators, i.e. compounds that increase intracellular mycobacterial survival. We have performed a small chemical screen using a biased set of bioactive compounds in an intracellular mycobacterial assay and identified few positive modulators. These compounds have been validated by multiple independent methods. We hypothesize that these compounds affect cellular pathways that control the bacterial infection but are not sufficient to eradicate the bacteria. In the absence of this control, mycobacteria proliferate. These compounds can thus be used to find out the host-mediated pathways involved in keeping the mycobacterial growth in control inside the macrophages</p> <br> UNDERSTANDING FUNCTIONAL POOLS OF PHOSPHATIDYINOSITOL 4,5-BISPHOSPHATE AT THE PLASMA MEMBRANE </br><br><p>Phosphatidylinositol 4,5- bisphosphate (PIP2) is a minor class of signaling lipid primarily found on the inner leaflet of plasma membrane . It can regulate a wide array of subcellular functions in this location simultaneously. PIP2 can directly bind to downstream effector proteins leading to regulation of functions such as endocytosis and maintenance of cytoskeleton. Else, it can be hydrolyzed by enzymes such as phospholipase C leading to the production of second messengers such as IP3 and DAG. It has been proposed that functionally distinct pools of PIP2 underlie the ability of a single molecule to regulate such diverse functions with high fidelity at the plasma membrane. The mechanism by which such pools might be generated and maintained remains disputed. Work done in our lab has shown that functional pools of PIP2 generated by distinct lipid kinases exist on the plasma membrane of Drosophila photoreceptors. The gene dPIP5K encodes a lipid kinase that produces a PLC sensitive pool of PIP2 involved in photo transduction. Another lipid kinase encoded by skittles is required to generate PIP2 required for housekeeping functions. The dPIP5K gene is spliced to generate multiple splice forms with a conserved lipid kinase domain and a variable C-terminus. We hypothesize that the variable C terminus regions of these dPIP5K variants mediate specific interactions with effector proteins leading to localized, context dependent production of PIP2. To address this hypothesis I am investigating the functions of photoreceptor enriched splice form of dPIP5K. In the last AWS, I had provided evidence for the existence of an eye-enriched splice variant of dPIP5K. This time, I will discuss how this spliceform, with an extended C terminus, behaves differently from the other form in the context of phototransduction in Drosophila.</p> <br> Spike timing precision and reliability in a mouse model of Fragile X syndrome </br><br><p>Studies done for cortical networks, hippocampal slices and cultures have&nbsp;put forward the idea of reliability and precision in spikes produced&nbsp;by a neuron, for repeated trials of same current stimuli. Its a&nbsp;published result that the reliability and precision of producing spikes&nbsp;by a neuron is higher in a noisy stimulus and these parameters drop in&nbsp;the presence of an excitable network and in altered functioning of some<br />channels. Fragile X disease is associated with increased network&nbsp;excitability and malfunctioning of many ion channels. My hypothesis is&nbsp;the reliability and precision in spikes are impaired in Fragile X&nbsp;syndrome mice models. My data till now shows that precision in spike&nbsp;response from a neuron is a developmental profile such that adult&nbsp;diseased animal model have more imprecision than younger ones. Also some<br />very preliminary mechanistic analysis points out the role of some K+&nbsp;conducatnces.</p> <br> Social regulation of the waggle dance activity of Individual honey bee foragers </br><br><p>Honey bee colonies are made up of one reproducing queen and ten thousands of sterile workers who perform all the tasks required for colony maintenance and growth. Foragers form a quarter of the work force of the colony but need to bring in enough food for the whole colony. To ensure that there is efficient exploration and exploitation of the food resources around the colony, honey bees have evolved the waggle dance as a recruitment mechanism. The waggle dance is used by foragers to inform other nest mates about the exact spatial location as well as reward value associated with a particular food source.<br />So far, most studies on the waggle dance have only looked at groups of foragers. There is very little information about individual forager responses and the various social interactions that might potentially affect individual dance behaviour.<br />In my project, I am observing the waggle dance behaviour of individual foragers under semi-natural foraging conditions. I will show how individual dance activity is a consistent behavioural phenomenon under stable environmental and food reward conditions, within the context of foraging groups. I will also show how manipulation of the foraging group composition, either by removing foragers or adding recruits can have opposing effects on an individual forager&rsquo;s dance activity. I will briefly touch on the social interactions in the hive which can produce the effects seen in my experiments.<br />Finally, I will show results from initial experiments trying to understand the mechanism behind this individual variation. I use two different approaches to try and understand this phenomenon. First, I use an established response threshold, the Gustatory Response Threshold (quantified using a lab assay), to try and find correlations between variation in this threshold and dance activity amongst individual foragers. Next, I will show preliminary results from Agent Based Simulations, wherein I try to find out the minimal set of individual specific parameters that are sufficient to explain the consistent individual variation that I see from my experimental observations.<br />Overall, my project opens up a whole new perspective on the waggle dance behaviour while at the same time shedding new light on how the social environment can fine tune and adjust the behaviour of individuals to the benefit of the colony.</p> <br> Probing the role of phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate in Drosophila melanogaster </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Phosphoinositides are a minor class of phospholipids found in various membranes in the cell. They are known to impact cell signaling and in turn the physiology of the organism. Amongst the three monophosphorylated phosphoinositides, phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PI5P) is the least abundant one. In the last decade, PI5P has been implicated in various signaling contexts like nuclear stress signaling, immune responses and cell migration. Yet its physiological role in an organismal level is relatively unexplored.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Phosphatidylinositol 5 phosphate 4 kinase (dPIP4K) is the main enzyme in <em>Drosophila</em> that metabolizes PI5P. Previous work from our laboratory shows that <em>dPIP4K<sup>29</sup></em>, a loss-of-function mutant of dPIP4K, have elevated levels of PI5P and a reduction in cell size (Gupta et al., 2013). The levels of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, the product of this kinase, remained unchanged in<em> dPIP4K<sup>29</sup></em>. However, it is unclear whether the elevated levels of PI5P or a locally decreased pool of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> could be linked to the decreased cell size phenotype. We know that most of the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> that is generated in metazoans, come from the more abundant PIP, PI4P, and presumably that is the reason why changes in the levels of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in <em>dPIP4K<sup>29</sup></em> were negligible. Hence, we hypothesized that the decrease in cell size in <em>dPIP4K<sup>29</sup></em> could be linked to increased levels of PI5P.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this AWS I will present genetic evidence which suggests that the decreased cell size in <em>dPIP4K<sup>29</sup></em> could be linked to increased PI5P rather than local changes in PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. In order to independently validate this observation, we went on to standardize approaches to biochemically measure PI5P in <em>Drosophila</em>. I will present some preliminary biochemical data on PI5P levels in these genetic manipulations.</p>

Depending on the number of ubiquitin molecules (chain length) and the nature of the chain linkage attached to the substrate, ubiquitination<br />may exert control over a wide array of cellular processes such as intracellular trafficking, signaling and protein degradation. The central players in the process of ubiquitination are the E2 family enzymes which receive Ub from an E1 enzyme forming a thioester-linked E2~Ub conjugate and subsequently transfer it onto the substrate with the help of E3 enzymes. The vast majority of all known E3 ligases fall into RING-domain-containing class which promote Ub transfer directly onto the substrate by stabilising a specific closed conformation of the E2~Ub conjugate. Analysis of several crystallographic structures of E2~Ub-RING E3 complexes reveals a conserved network of hydrogen bonds employed by RING-E3s to stabilise the conformation of E2~Ub.<br />Some E2 enzymes have been reported to possess E3-independent ubiquitination activity (eg. Ubc1, Ubc13 and Cdc34) for which the underlying mechanism is unclear. In recent crystallographic complexes of Ubc13~Ub-RING E3, we observed additional hydrogen bonds between two residues of Ubc13 and Ub in the closed conformation which are absent in similar structures of E3-dependent E2s. We hypothesized that these additional contacts could potentially play a role in stabilising the catalytically active closed conformation of E2~Ub and thus promote E3-independent ubiquitination.<br />Molecular dynamics simulations of E2~Ub conjugates suggested a possible role for these contacts in stabilising the closed conformation. Multiple sequence alignment of various E3-independent E2s revealed that the identity of the two E2 residues making additional contacts with Ub were conserved. The importance of these residues was subjected to experimental validation using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro ubiquitination assays to assess the extent of polyubiquitin chain formation. Consistent with our hypothesis, substitution of the conserved residue pair alone was sufficient to abolish E3-independent activity in Ubc1/UbE2K. Interestingly, the introduction of this residue pair into UbcH5B resulted in the acquisition of E3-independent activity.<br />In conclusion, our results highlight that subtle sequence differences at key positions on the E2&nbsp;enzyme can considerably modulate the conformational landscape of E2~Ub conjugates and may lead to unique functional capabilities across the E2 family.</p> <br> Time restricted feeding/foraging and entrainment of circadian clock in honeybees </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Apis mellifera</em>, the European-African honeybee species, has been known for their remarkable time memory and highly adaptive circadian clock. They can virtually learn any time of the day when food is available and adjust their daily activity rhythm accordingly, visiting a food source only when it is most profitable. Like mice and other animals, time restricted foraging results in food anticipatory behavior and entrainment of daily activity rhythm in honeybees too. However, the molecular basis of food entrainment in insects has not been studied much. Also most of the food entrainment experiments are done in constant laboratory conditions and it is not clear whether and how feeding or foraging activity functions as a zeitgeber under natural light-dark cycle. To investigate the effect of restricted foraging time on the molecular clock under natural conditions, I performed a time-restricted feeder training experiments in an outdoor flight chamber (12m x 5m x 2.5m). I trained honeybee foragers to visit an artificial (sucrose solution) feeder either in the morning or in the afternoon for several consecutive days and analyzed the daily clock gene expression rhythm in different brain parts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I found that the phase of clock genes expression rhythm (Cry2, PER) was significantly different between morning and afternoon trained foragers. More importantly, the phase difference was even larger when the feeder was scented with an odor (linalool).</p> <br> Cross-feeding metabolisms: yay or nay? </br><br><p>In microbial communities, bacterial cells often exchange costly metabolites with each other. This 'cross-feeding' behaviour is assumed to facilitate&nbsp;an overall fitness benefit to both interacting partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, in terms of the biochemistry of metabolisms, what form is this fitness benefit likely to be in? Is it likely to be through increased ATP&nbsp;yields in the metabolic network? Or a genome size reduction? Maybe increased biomass yields?</p>
<p>By&nbsp;constructing many possible metabolic networks both&nbsp;cross-feeding and solitary, we investigate cases where the former class are likely to be more beneficial than the latter, and through&nbsp;what&nbsp;means.</p> <br> Environmental stress-induced plasticity in gene regulation of a mountain plant species (Primula sikkimensis) </br><br><p>Environmental stress is a major factor that determines the distribution of plants. We compared the gene expression profile of a high elevation mountain plant species Primula sikkimensis, with its ambient and stress environmental condition with the aim to understand the mechanisms of stress responses.</p>
<p>We found a decline in the fitness of P. sikkimensis at environmental stress conditions. Based on the expression profile of 21,167 genes, 109 and 85 genes were found to be significantly differentially expressed in both the below ambient and above ambient stress conditions. The results demonstrate the ability of P. sikkimensis for rapid adaptation to environmental stress through plastic transcriptomic responses. However, reduced fitness under stress condition may decline, population growth rate.</p> <br> Understanding Fyn kinase signaling using a generalized toolbox of fluorescent biosensors </br><br><p>Cellular signaling controls key aspects of a cell's function and it is now clear that signaling pathways do not function independently but are deeply interconnected. Activities of signaling proteins that help in propagation of information through these pathways therefore need to be controlled stringently in space and time. Fyn kinase, a member of the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, is known to be an important regulator of migration in a variety of metastatic cancers. However, a better understanding of its role in this process has been lacking due to the paucity of specific tools available owing to the high degree of homology amongst the Src kinases. By adapting a high through-put screening pipeline we have been able to generate a very specific FRET based "biosensor" for Fyn kinase. Using this sensor we find that cells plated on fibronectin (an integrin ligand) are highly polarized with respect to Fyn activity and that on addition of Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), an amplification in this polarized signal is achieved. This is the first conclusive evidence showing involvement of Fyn in mediating cross-talk between different types of receptors and such an approach could help uncover a general mechanism for Fyn's biological action.</p> <br> Notch signalling and calcium homeostasis </br><br><p>Notch signalling is conserved across metazoans, regulating diverse cellular processes including growth, differentiation, migration and survival. Notch1 activity inhibited a calcium flux triggered during apoptotic signalling initiated by the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, in mammalian cells. This prompted us to ask if Notch1 activity regulates intracellular calcium. Calcium plays a critical role in the initiation and amplification of apoptotic cascades involving the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria.</p>
<p>In the AWS last year I reported that free calcium levels in the ER, measured using a well-characterized organelle-specific sensor, were reduced in mammalian cell lines expressing the processed Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD). NICD modulation of ER calcium was dependent on IP3R3, VDAC1, Grp75 (established earlier) and MCU, which together control the release of calcium from the ER and its uptake by mitochondria. My experiments&nbsp; also established that mitochondrial calcium uptake contributed to the observed reduction in ER calcium. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I will now describe experiments that follow up on these observations, to test the requirement of STIM and ORAI, which ensure the influx of calcium from the extracellular space into the cytoplasm and ER, following emptying of ER stores. I will also discuss experiments I propose to examine if the redistribution of cellular calcium is&nbsp; required for Notch-dependent activation of autophagy and mitochondrial remodelling in primary T-cells.</p> <br> In vivo regulation of Phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PITPs) during PhospholipaseC (PLC) mediated signalling. </br><br><p>Many cellular signalling processes which are mediated by activation of phospholipase C (PLC) leads to hydrolysis of Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate(PIP<sub>2</sub>) at the plasma membrane. PIP<sub>2</sub> is a minor class of phospholipid and its hydrolysis by PLC generates the secondary messengers Inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) and Diacylglycerol (DAG) which in turn activate downstream pathways. Hence for sustained signalling, PIP<sub>2</sub> should be resynthesized at the plasma membrane for which it requires its biochemical precursor molecule, phosphatidylinositol (PI). PI is synthesized within the endoplasmic reticulum(ER) from where it is trafficked to the PM with the help of proteins termed as Phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PITPs). In addition to binding and transferring PI, PITPs have been shown to bind and transfer other phospholipids like phosphatidylcholine (PC) or phosphatidic acid (PA) <em>in vitro</em>.</p>
<p>Although PITPs have been extensively characterized biochemically <em>in vitro</em>, what remains largely unexplored is the <em>in vivo</em> regulation of their function. To understand their regulation, I study the role of a PITP named RDGB (Retinal Degeneration B) using <em>Drosophila</em> as a model system. RDGB is expressed predominantly in <em>Drosophila</em> photoreceptors and loss of <em>rdgB</em> function leads to various <em>in vivo</em> phenotypes. Although the primary function of PI transfer is conserved across all PITPs, there are differences in the mechanisms that regulate this function in vivo. In this AWS I shall present data on the regulation of RDGB function by its extended C-terminus <em>in vivo</em>.</p> <br> Fast and Furious: Dopaminergic control of swim speed in zebrafish larvae </br><br><p>Dopamine (DA) is a key modulator of motor systems across invertebrates and vertebrates. Loss of dopaminergic neurons or imbalance in dopamine levels has been implicated in several motor disorders such as Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and Restless Leg Syndrome. Several studies have high-lighted the importance of DA in regulating motor function in zebrafish larvae. However, the effect of DA on target cell populations and the circuits mediating these behavioural changes have not been looked at.</p>
<p>Optomotor response (OMR) is an innate behaviour induced by drifting gratings to which zebrafish larvae respond by turning towards and following the direction of moving stimulus. The stereotypic behavioural response during OMR as opposed to variable spontaneous swimming, enables easy characterisation and quantification of swimming kinematics. Two-photon imaging has revealed important putative dopaminergic targets, reticulospinal neurons and cerebellum, to be active during this behaviour. This important, evoked, innate behaviour provides an opportunity to delineate the role of DA in fine-tuning the motor output and characterise the underlying circuit.Since DA binds to two subtypes of receptors, D1-like and D2-like, we looked at individual contributions of these competing signaling pathways on modulation of OMR.</p>
<p>During OMR, with activation of D1R, zebrafish larvae swam faster and travelled greater distance per bout. A finer kinematic analysis revealed increase in tail beat frequency and tail beat amplitude with D1R activation. However, duration of swim bouts and frequency of swims were unaffected. D1R activation also resulted in sharper turns with an increase in the maximum tail bend angle. Similar kinematic parameters changed with D2R antagonism.<br />These results indicate a role of DA signaling in modulating swim speed in zebrafish larvae. <br />Modulation of swim speed in zebrafish larvae depends on the recruitment pattern of motor neurons as well as spinal interneurons. Further experiments will focus on understanding how DA affects this recruitment pattern to bring about faster locomotion.</p> <br> Role of stationary-phase sigma factor rpoS and cAMP phosphodiesterase cpdA during adaptation under prolonged stationary phase in Escherichia coli </br><br><p>One of the outstanding questions in biology is &ldquo;How repeatable is evolution?&rdquo; Natural populations adapt by selecting rare beneficial mutations that increase fitness. This raises a possibility that a limited number of beneficial mutations may constrain genetic paths to adaptation thus making evolution repeatable under a specific environment. Prolonged stationary phase evolution in Lysogeny Broth (LB) batch cultures offer a complex yet fairly reproducible experimental evolution system to study adaptation in the laboratory. Extending stationary-phase restricts growth due to rapid exhaustion of readily available nutrients which is aggravated by alkaline conditions in addition to oxidative stress and accumulation of metabolic wastes. Starving E. coli populations continuously select mutations that confer growth advantage under prolonged stationary phase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Six replicates of E. coli were evolved in LB batch cultures for twenty-eight days. The founder strain carried an adaptive allele of rpoS which encodes an alternate sigma factor that drives expression of general stress regulon. This rpoS variant referred as rpoS819 has a 46 base pair duplication at the C-terminus. During the first week of evolution the 46 base duplication in rpoS819 further duplicated in five populations. Direct competition between rpoS819 and the new allele, rpoS819_92 populations showed that the latter is a fitter allele. Another constant target of mutation and selection was the cAMP phosphodiesterase gene, cpdA. A strain with complete deletion of cpdA has higher competitive fitness compared to the parent with wild type cpdA under stationary-phase. One of the isolates carrying the naturally selected cpdA allele with a 3bp deletion (486-488) displayed strong fitness. Interestingly, two of the natural cpdA clones isolated from evolved populations also carried the rpoS819_92 allele. These mutations suggest that there is an evolutionary remodulation of the rpoS stress regulon and cAMP- CRP regulon under prolonged stationary-phase. Further mapping of systemic transcriptional changes will expand our understanding of how these two regulatory networks are altered at the molecular level to confer adaptive phenotype.</p> <br> PAI-1 mediates mast cell-fibroblast interactions in a mouse model of fibrosis </br><br><p>Fibrosis is a pathological condition, which forms a common link between cancer, autoimmune disorders like scleroderma, myocardial infarction and numerous other diseases that involves the excessive deposition of connective tissue in an organ.&nbsp; Given its widespread occurrence, fibrosis is responsible for one-third of the deaths worldwide, making a study of the causal mechanisms of this condition imperative to identify therapeutics which are currently lacking.&nbsp; The hallmark of fibrosis is the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix components including collagen, which results from the activation of fibroblasts via different pathways.&nbsp; One of these pathways requires an immune cell type known as mast cells.&nbsp; Although the mast cell-fibroblast interaction has long been established, the mechanisms which regulate this phenomenon and the downstream consequences relative to fibrogenesis, are still unknown.&nbsp; We have attempted to address these open questions using a mouse model of fibrosis, wherein the transcription factor Snail is ectopically overexpressed in the epidermis of the skin.&nbsp; Our data suggests that the protein Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1), secreted from the Snail transgenic epidermal cells, acts as a chemotactic factor to stimulate mast cell migration as well as their adhesion to fibroblasts.&nbsp; This PAI-1 mediated increased mast cell-fibroblast attachment results from an increase in the expression of a novel mast cell receptor on the fibroblasts via activation of the &alpha;V integrin-Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) signaling pathway.&nbsp; Furthermore, this heterotypic cell-cell adhesion culminates in the reciprocal activation of both the mast cells and fibroblasts.&nbsp; The activated mast cells express the activation markers, namely the interleukins IL-4 and IL-13.&nbsp; The adherent fibroblasts in turn get transformed to active myofibroblasts as evidenced by the increased &alpha;-Smooth Muscle Actin (&alpha;SMA) expression, collagen contraction and fibroblast proliferation.&nbsp; Thus, we have identified novel mechanisms by which PAI-1 functions as an integral component in fibrogenesis at the inflammatory phase of disease development.</p> <br> A cluster of microRNAs regulate anthocyanin development in Vitis vinifera by targeting MYB transcription factors </br><br><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogeneously expressed non-coding small, ~21nt RNAs involved in the negative regulation of gene expression. In plants, primary miRNAs are transcribed from MIR genes by RNA polymerase II. These pri-miRNAs form stem-loop structured pre-miRNA, that are processed into miRNA-miRNA* duplex by an endonuclease, Dicer-like 1. One of the strand from miRNA-miRNA* duplex is selected and loaded on to Argonaute 1 to mediate the cleavage of complementary mRNA (Post Transcriptional Gene Silencing). In plants, miRNAs are known to play a critical role in developmental and metabolic pathways. Studies in Arabidopsis (Gou et al., 2011) and apple (Xia et al., 2012) have shown that microRNAs regulate the expression of MYB transcription factors, thereby involved in the anthocyanin synthesis. Anthocyanins are plant phenolic compounds required for attracting pollinators, seed dispersal and to defend against the biotic and abiotic stresses. They are synthesized through phenylpropanoid pathway, which is regulated by MYB transcription factors. We find miRNAs with the potential to target MYB transcription are abundant in grapes (Vitis vinifera) and other fruits having high anthocyanin content. More than 60% of all R2R3 MYB transcription factors from Vitis are targets of these miRNAs. In order to understand the specific role of these miRNAs in anthocyanin development, we took advantage of three different coloured grapes with varying anthocyanin content. Northern hybridization experiments suggested that black and red grapes have a higher accumulation of all three MYB regulating miRNAs. One of the miRNAs involved in regulating MYB mRNAs is a 22 nt miRNA. Typical of all 22 nt miRNAs, this induces a secondary silencing cascade to generate numerous phased siRNAs, all capable of targeting other MYB RNAs.&nbsp; Our results pave way for artificial enhancement of these key antioxidant compounds among plants by regulating specific MYBs involved in anthocyanin.</p> <br> Detecting cooperative interactions between transcription factors with ChIP-seq and CPI-EM </br><br><p>Understanding the factors that affect a transcription factor's (TF) affinity toward DNA is important not only in constructing gene regulatory networks but also in understanding changes in transcriptional regulation between species. To a large extent, a TF's binding affinity for DNA is dictated by the sequence being bound. More recent experiments, which were made possible by the&nbsp; availability of sequencing technologies, showed that binding affinity depends on factors other than the sequence being bound. One such factor is cooperative binding, where the binding of one TF can make it easier for a second TF to bind DNA nearby. Cooperative binding that involves protein-protein interactions are relatively easy to detect with existing genomic algorithms that analyze the sequences bound by these TFs. However, a lot of cooperative binding events need not involve protein-protein interactions, which makes it likely that purely sequence based algorithms might not detect them. </p>
<p>We developed an algorithm, called ChIP-seq Peak Intensity - Expectation Maximization (CPI-EM), that detects sites of cooperative binding between two TFs after a ChIP-seq experiment has been performed on each of them. ChIP-seq (Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing) is a method that provides a list of genomic locations bound by a transcription factor (TF) along with a noisy measure of the binding affinities (called peak intensities) at each location. The highlight of CPI-EM is that it does not utilize any information on the sequence being bound by the TF pair to detect cooperative binding between them. Our work points to the value of including peak intensities along with sequence-based critera in cooperativity detection. If time permits, I will also discuss our recent attempts to simulate a typical ChIP-seq experiment, which allows us to understand the extent to which ChIP-seq can be used to make inferences about TF-DNA binding. </p> <br> Understanding the role of transmembrane helix of STIM1 </br><br><p>Calcium signalling is ubiquitous and "Ja, Kalzium, das ist alles". When used as a second messenger, calcium is generally mobilised from its store in the cell&nbsp;- the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). So, for signalling to ensue, the cellular calcium store has to remain full at all times. Thus, non-excitable cells in metazoans have evolved a mechanism to sense and maintain the ER store of calcium because any imbalance there has pathophysiological consequences. The protein which performs this function is STIM1 and it resides on the ER membrane. Since the discovery of STIM1 about a decade ago, we have come to understand a lot about this protein. However, details about its mechanism of activation are still incomplete. We tried to study the role of the transmembrane region of STIM1 in its activation. Our data suggests that the sequence of the transmembrane domain of STIM1 is dispensable for its function. Merely linking the two soluble parts of the protein on either side of the ER membrane through any transmembrane helix should suffice to recapitulate STIM1 function.</p> <br> Deciphering the role of miR397 in rice domestication </br><br><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) that are usually 21 nt long and are produced from endogenously expressed MIR genes. miRNAs are involved in regulating development and disease resistance. We are interested in identifying role of small RNAs and epigenetics in rice domestication. Analysis of sRNA datasets from two wild species (Oryza nivara and O. rufipogon) and one cultivated species of rice, revealed a surprisingly higher abundance of small RNAs originating from Chromosome 2 in wild rice species. This locus codes for a 22 nt miRNA 397. miR397 is highly abundant in flag leaf, a tissue that usually provides 70% of energy required for grain filling. In model dicot plant Arabidopsis thaliana, miR397 targets laccase mRNAs, although a functional significance of this interaction has not been understood. Laccases are a key group of proteins with 17 (as in arabidopsis) to 30 copies (as in rice) in plant genomes. They are involved in lignin polymerization, an important step in a range of plant processes such as lignification of vascular bundles, plant architecture and height. We found that miR397 targets 13 different isoforms of laccase mRNAs in rice. Biochemical analysis indicated that wild rice has reduced laccase activity than cultivated rice. Typical of 22 nt miRNAs, miR397 in O. nivara triggers a secondary cascade silencing by producing small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) from laccase mRNAs. These secondary siRNAs are observed only among wild rice species but not in cultivated rice. We use a range of genetic, biochemical and molecular techniques to understand contribution of miR397 in rice domestication-associated phenotypes.</p> <br> Mapping and analysis of heterogeneous precursors in Drosophila lymph gland hematopoiesis  </br><br><p>Drosophila hematopoiesis is spatio-temporally regulated; the embryonic anlage mainly gives rise to differentiated blood cells. The second wave of hematopoiesis takes place in the larval lymph gland that harbors differentiated blood cells and progenitors. The lymph gland is a multi-lobed organ consisting of primary and posterior lobes. While the cellular composition and molecular signals that regulate progenitors in the primary lobe are extensively studied, limited studies suggest that the posterior lobes harbor the major pool of progenitors. Our aim is to delineate the fate and function of the lymph gland progenitors. Mapping posterior lobe progenitors for known hematopoietic markers, showed heterogeneous non-overlapping pattern of gene expression that is maintained during pupal stages of development. Progenitors seem to follow an anterior to posterior sequence of release into circulation in early pupal stages. However we find that lymph gland progenitors are not essential for adult hematopoiesis and immune functions. Preliminary analyses suggest that lymph gland progenitors (primary and posterior lobes) form lamellocytes upon wasp infections. We hypothesize that larval lymph glands harbor multipotent progenitor pools that could be activated by specific immune challenges, which is being investigated further.</p>
<p><br /> </p> <br> Phagosomal and endosomal pathway in mycobacterium infected macrophages  </br><br><p>Endocytosis is an essential pathway for many fundamental cellular processes ranging from nutrient uptake to downstream signal transduction. Various GTPases e.g. Rab GTPases regulate the intracellular trafficking of endocytosed cargo. The pathway is also exploited by many intracellular pathogens for entry and intracellular survival. One of these threatening pathogens is Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)- the causative agent of tuberculosis disease. Mycobacterium invades macrophages through phagocytosis and sustains inside the cell by inhibiting phagolysosomal fusion. Several studies have suggested that Mycobacteria inside cell interacts with endocytic pathway and modulates it for purposes like iron acquisition but modulations posed by Mycobacteria to endocytic pathway are still underexplored. In this study, we used labeled endocytic tracers (Transferrin &amp; dextran) to identify these potential modulations in the endocytic pathway and their significance for Mycobacterial pathogenesis. Our results suggest that the macrophages with high endocytic capacity also have a higher probability to get infected with Mycobacterium thus are more prone to infection. This could be one of the reasons for heterogeneous mycobacterial infection. Overall our experiments suggest that intrinsic heterogeneity in the endocytic capacity of cells could be determinants of infectivity and pathogens such as mycobacteria could be exploiting this for their benefit. Further experiments are needed to strengthen and validate these conclusions.</p> <br> Coevolution of bacterial tRNA gene copy number and codon usage bias depends on amino acid specific features </br><br><p></p>
<p>To encode almost any amino acid, a choice of multiple (2-6) synonymous codons is available. Within bacterial genomes, highly expressed genes (HEG) preferentially use synonymous codons that are decoded by abundant tRNAs. A match between codon use and tRNA abundance is thought to make translation elongation faster and/or accurate. As cells grow faster, translation of HEGs becomes more important, making selection on these traits stronger. Consequently, theoretical models of coevolution predict that preference for specific codon(s) for each amino acid i.e. codon usage bias (CUB) and the corresponding tRNA gene copy numbers (GCN) will increase with bacterial growth rates. These predictions have only been quantitatively tested for overall tRNA GCN and CUB averaged across amino acids.</p>
<p>In this seminar, I will describe our findings from investigations of the tRNA GCN and CUB for specific amino acids. Our default expectation was that the response of these traits to increasing growth rate should be stronger for more frequently used amino acids. We did find that the growth rate associated increase in tRNA GCN was higher for frequently used amino acids. Surprisingly, similar trends were not observed in the response of CUB, which had no correlation with amino acid usage. Especially, CUB was weak for some frequently used amino acids. We tested another explanation of these observations in <em>E. coli</em>, and found some evidence that intrinsic decoding rates of specific codons may influence selection. Our findings generate new predictions for molecular studies, and if corroborated, raise the question of why more favorable molecular features have not evolved. Moreover, our results may have implications for designing codon optimized genes.</p> <br> The biology of Indian butterfly migrations </br><br><p>Danaine butterflies in south India undergo a multispecies, biannual migration between the Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats. Four species of milkweed butterflies swarm in large numbers and undertake a longitudinal, monsoon-driven migration along the east-west axis over the course of two months. Little data is available on the specific environmental conditions that prime this migration. Our preliminary population data from the migratory swarms helps to characterize this unique migratory system in the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>Long-distance migration is frequently associated with various phenotypic and behavioral changes in migrants. Phenotypic differences in body ratios are indicative of differential investment in body parts, and consequently, in life-history traits dependent on these body parts. We collected and analyzed morphometric data from individuals of the four migratory species to find evidence for such trade-offs. Our results suggest that active migrants regulate energetic investments so as to optimize migratory flight efficiency. Future work on this system will focus on the behavioral and genetic differences between migrants and non-migrants.</p> <br> Distribution of Himalayan pikas and modelling impacts of climatic fluctuations  </br><br><p>The impacts of past climatic fluctuations on the evolution, distribution and genetic diversity are well documented for some species. Pikas are known as indicator species as they can signal changes in the environment. These species have restricted ranges on the mountain tops because they are highly adapted to cold and have limited dispersal ability. The Himalaya, and the sub - Himalayan ranges include 25% of the total pika diversity. High species richness in these relatively specialized species provides a unique opportunity to understand evolution in the context of montane habitats. Unfortunately, studies on Himalayan pikas are limited. Therefore, we started with a basic, yet important question addressing the distribution of pikas along the elevation gradients. Niche overlap using Schoener index were calculated between the species pairs to understand the patterns of pika species assembly. Climatic niche breadth and elevation range of these pika species were calculated to infer on their robustness towards climatic variation as species with wider climatic niche breadth are thought to be more robust toward climatic fluctuation. Six pika species were sampled from the study area. Four out of six species were unevenly distributed along the elevation gradient. Species belonging to different subgenera showed contrasting niche evolution patterns. Species belonging to subgenus Conothoa showed niche divergence whereas, species belonging to subgenus Ochotona indicated niche conservatism. We discuss these patterns possibly depends on the divergence time of the species under comparison. Armed with this knowledge on their distribution pattern, we developed correlative climatic models with occurrence records collected in the field. I will be presenting climatic model developed for a pika species with wide geographic range. The model was then projected to different climate change scenarios in the past and future to understand if they predict range shift. In future, we intend to develop similar climatic models for other pika species to be able to present a comparative framework for species with different ranges.</p> <br> Ezh2 histone methyltransferase activity in wound healing </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Histone lysine methyl marks deposited by methyltransferases have emerged as key players of development and homeostasis. In this study, we profiled for repressive H3K27me3 marks governed by Ezh2 (a histone methyltransferase) in various age groups of mouse skin and identified heterogeneity in their specification particularly in adult dermal tissue. Ezh2 is known to be an important regulator for skin development but its role in wound healing still remains elusive. Our aim was to elucidate the role of Ezh2 methyltransferase activity in wound healing. In the current study, we demonstrate upregulation of Ezh2 activity upon wounding while H3K27me3 marks are differentially deposited in dermal compartments on complete regeneration. Isolation of papillary (CD26+) and reticular dermal fibroblasts (Sca-1+) revealed higher levels of H3K27me3 marks in papillary than reticular fibroblasts. Inhibition of Ezh2 methyltransferase activity <em>in vitro</em> in papillary fibroblasts using small molecule inhibitor, GSK126, resulted in their differentiation to reticular fibroblasts. Papillary dermal fibroblasts are crucial for epidermal and hair follicle maturation while reticular dermal fibroblasts are responsible for extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. In fact, inhibition of CD26+ population has been shown to delay wound healing response. To test if the differentiation observed <em>in vitro</em> could be recapitulated <em>in vivo</em>, we treated dorsal skin wounds with GSK126. Interestingly, regenerating dermal tissue was devoid of CD26 expression in GSK126 treated animal skin sections. Inhibition of Ezh2 activity resulted in reduced proliferation and migration of skin cells (keratinocytes and fibroblasts) leading to a delay in wound healing response. The results so far demonstrate that the differential level of Ezh2 activity is not only required for maintaining dermal fibroblasts heterogeneity but also for efficient wound healing.</p> <br> Translational regulation downstream of NMDAR and mGluR </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">In neurons, activity mediated protein synthesis is a critical component of synaptic plasticity. NMDAR and group I mGluR (glutamate receptors) are required in various forms of synaptic plasticity. Both of these receptors modulate synaptic protein synthesis but the specificity and mechanism of their translational response is not known. Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), an RNA binding protein (RBP) regulates the expression of its target mRNAs by recruitment of microRNA induced silencing complex (miRISC). On mGluR stimulation, this inhibition can be reversed to facilitate translation. Here I propose that FMRP-miRISC complex also regulates the translation downstream of NMDAR signalling. MOV10, a component of miRISC, in association with FMRP and AGO2 determines the translation response to NMDAR and mGluR. On NMDAR stimulation, MOV10 dissociates from AGO2 and promotes translation. For mGluR, MOV10 associates more with AGO2 and is reduced in polysomes. FMRP is essential for formation of MOV10-AGO2 mediated inhibitory complex and also to promote translation of MOV10 associated mRNAs. In the absence of FMRP, the dynamic shift of MOV10 between AGO2 and polysomes is abolished and hence the distinct translation response to both mGluR and NMDAR is lost. Thus, FMRP is essential for NMDAR mediated translation and likely to have a role in integrating mGluR and NMDAR mediated signalling. Also, ribosome profiling from rat cortical synaptoneurosomes establishes a distinct translation response on NMDAR and mGluR stimulation at genome-wide scale. In conclusion, differential translation is observed downstream of NMDAR and mGluR and is mediated by differential association of FMRP-MOV10-AGO2 on target mRNAs</p> <br> Probing the encounter complex ensemble of weak protein-protein association using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations </br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Weak protein-protein interactions are a hallmark of cellular signaling cascades, allowing information to be rapidly tansmitted across various regions across the cell. The process of weak protein-protein association can be described in terms of an energy landscape wherein the native/stereospecific complex occupies a global minima. The formation of various native complexes has been experimentally shown to be preceeded by an encounter complex ensemble (transient intermediates). This ensemble is characterised by weak electrostatic interactions and little desolvation of the interacting proteins. Computational studies of the encounter complex ensemble have historically employed brownian dynamics/coarse-grained simulations wherein protein flexibility/explicit solvent is omitted. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent using conventional forcefields suffer from undersolvation and over-stabilising salt bridges, thus impeding a detailed investigation of the encounter complex ensemble.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ubiqutination is a three step cascade involving the sequential action of E1, E2 and E3 enzymes. Weak E2-E3 interactions are crucial for the timely and efficient ubiquitination of numerous cellular substrates.&nbsp;We employed an optimised version of Amber99SB forcefield to successfully capture encounter states during the associaton of UBC13 (E2 enzyme) and TRAF6 RING (E3) in a manner consistent with their electrostatic surface potentials. The interaction between UBC13 and TRAF6 is disrupted by the deamidation of Q100 in UBC13 by the bacterial effector, OspI (<em>Shigella flexneria). </em>An investigation of this phenonomenon using our optimised forcefield indicates that deamidation biases the encounter complex ensemble towards non-native orientations by rendering the association energetics to be extremely unfavourable. This apparent bias in the encounter complex ensemble is unlikely to result in the formation of native complex. In conclusion, we show that using a forcefield optimised for accurate solvation and treatment of salt bridges can allow for a characterisation of the encounter complex ensemble at unprecedented atomistic detail.</p> <br> Was not provided by speaker </br><br><p>Was not provided by speaker.</p> <br> Fluorescent biosensor for visualizing endogenous protein kinase activation dynamics </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">The detection of metal ions, metabolites and second messenger in live cells are achieved with high <em>spatio</em>-temporal resolution using cutting edge techniques. However, no such tool existing for endogenous proteins. The classical biochemical and protein depletion approaches are limited in deciphering <em>spatio</em>-temporal regulation of these proteins. The protein activity biosensors are limited by the availability of reagents that specifically recognize the active forms of signaling proteins. Here, we describe a new kind of genetically-encoded biosensor, to detect the specific activity/conformational state of an unmodified, native protein for the first time in live cells. We specifically focused to build biosensor for ubiquitously expressed Fyn kinase, known to play a critical role in cell migration, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, cancer-metastasis, axonal guidance and patterning, and synaptic functions. The biosensor is genetically encoded fusion complex of tailored binder (from our earlier study) and circular permutation of green fluorescent protein. The sensor has ability to report specific Fyn kinase activation dynamics through green fluorescence in live cells. We will describe here in detail structural and functional optimizations of biosensor. These strategies can be used to study signaling targets that have been difficult to study using conventional techniques due to limitations of size, post-translational modifications etc.</p> <br> Different ends of the same message </br><br><p>In eukaryotes, 3'untranslated regions (UTRs) play important roles in regulating posttranscriptional gene expression. The 3'UTR is defined by regulated cleavage/polyadenylation of the pre-mRNA. The advent of next-generation sequencing technology has now enabled us to identify these events on a genome-wide scale. In this study, we used poly(A)-position profiling by sequencing (3P-Seq) to capture all poly(A) sites across the genome of the freshwater planarian, Schmidtea mediterranea, an ideal model system for exploring the process of regeneration and stem cell function. We identified the 3'UTRs for ~14,000 transcripts and thus improved the existing gene annotations. We found 97 transcripts, which are polyadenylated within an internal exon, resulting in the shrinking of the ORF and loss of a predicted protein domain. Around 40% of the transcripts in planaria were alternatively polyadenylated (ApA), resulting either in an altered 3'UTR or a change in coding sequence. We identified specific ApA transcript isoforms that were subjected to miRNA mediated gene regulation using degradome sequencing. In this study, we also confirmed a tissue-specific expression pattern for alternate polyadenylated transcripts. Using custom made microarray chip we were able to identify transcripts that were enriched in planarian stem cells. The insights from this study highlight the potential role of ApA in regulating the gene expression essential for planarian stem cells.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are currently investigating molecular players that might be regulating alternate polyadenylation in planarian stem cells. Knock down of two core cleavage/polyadenylation machinery protein in planaria led to lysis of the animal. Targets and mechanism of action of these proteins in maintaining planarian stem cells is yet to be deciphered.</p> <br> Dynamics and organization of the GPCR Smog during epithelial morphogenesis </br><br><p>Local nano- and meso-scale organization of membrane constituents primes the cell to adapt and react to&nbsp;the&nbsp;external milieu [1]. The dynamics of this organization is necessary for information transfer [2]. Although the organization of membrane components have been studied in tissue culture, it is relatively unexplored in an '<em>in-vivo</em>' context.</p>
<p>During germband elongation in gastrulating <em>Drosophila</em> embryos, tissue scale dynamics are accomplished by cell-contact rearrangements. Assymetric cell intercalation is a main mechanism by which the germband is elongated. This takes place via the activation of a conserved Rho-Rok pathway that stimulates MyoII-based contractility at both the apico-medial and the junctional plane of the transforming ectoderm. The pathway itself is initiated at the cell membrane via the sensitization of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Here, I will report on our efforts to quantitatively assess the dynamic membrane organization of a GPCR&nbsp; (Smog) in the ectoderm of <em>Drosophila</em> embryos. Cluster size distribution, mobility and abundance of Smog are under the tight control of beta-arrestin, a GPCR adaptor protein that is recruited upon interaction of the GPCR with its ligand, Fog. These features results in the accurate control and tuning of signalling and therefore MyoII activation during cell intercalation.</p>

CNC originate from ectoderm from the border of developing central nervous system and epidermis and generates ectodermal lineage cell types such as neurons and glia. Remarkably, it also generates typical &lsquo;mesodermal&rsquo; lineage cell types like bone, cartilage and connective tissue in the head. Mechanism of this extraordinary 'trans-germ' layer differentiation potential of CNC is not fully understood. Here we aim to investigate the mechanistic basis of &lsquo;mesodermal&rsquo; character of CNC with special emphasis on micro-RNAs (miRs).&nbsp; The approach is to perform global screen to identify miRs enriched in CNC. We have successfully generated neural crest like cells (NCLC) <em>in vitro</em> using a previously reported method of guided differentiation of human embryonic stem cells. We show that the NCLCs recapitulate the developmental pattern, especially, the temporal sequence of induction of key markers. Using this model system, we have identified six miRs enriched in NCLCs. Interestingly, the NCLC enriched miRs belong to ancient vertebrate miR families.&nbsp; Therefore, acquisition of these miRs in the genome correlates with the acquisition of neural crest suggesting an ancient function of these miRs in the development of CNC. Bioinformatic prediction of targets suggests NCLC- enriched miRs target components of key signalling pathways involved in neural crest development. These signalling pathways include Wnt, ErbB, TGF-&szlig; and FGF signalling. While Wnt and ErbB signalling are known to favour the progression of neural crest development towards neuronal lineages, TGF-&szlig; and FGF signalling plays crucial role in fate choice of 'mesodermal' lineages of neural crest cells. We hypothesize that NCLC enriched miRs regulate signalling output of key signalling pathways, which in turn regulates both the cell behaviour and differentiation potential to influence the fate choice of neural crest cells.</p> <br> Cross talk between global transcription regulators CRP and FIS in E. coli </br><br><p>For years, bacterial gene regulation was thought to follow a "single regulator, single gene" paradigm. Exhaustive work has been done towards understanding transcriptional regulation on a gene by gene basis. These results have paved a strong framework for the understanding of the regulation of gene expression. In recent years, with the advent of next generation sequencing, it is now feasible to understand the effects and interactions of these regulators at a genome-wide level. In this work, we have focused on crosstalk between global transcription factors CRP and FIS, and have used several methods to ascertain their role in E. coli. Our study sought to examine the different aspects of CRP-FIS crosstalk and their implications on bacterial growth, transcriptional profiles and differential binding on the chromosome. Gene deletions were performed for these regulators, individually, as well as in combination. Growth, RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq results demonstrate that genomic scale cross talk exists between these two global regulators. The effect of an individual regulator on growth is minor, but the absence of both the regulators led to a severe growth defect. The transcriptome profiles of the single and double deletions overlap to a significant extent. Further investigation of the overlap revealed growth phase dependent contributions of the single deletions to the double deletion transcription profile. Analysis of binding profile reveals the differential binding patterns dependent upon growth phase and presence or absence of the other regulator. These results point toward substantial regulatory crosstalk between CRP and FIS, and the effect of this crosstalk on bacterial growth.</p> <br> Diversity and adaptations in the giant honey bees, Apis dorsata and Apis laboriosa. </br><br><p><em>A. dorsata</em> and <em>A. laboriosa</em> are two important wild honey bee pollinator species in India. They show fascinating behaviors such as self-organization, migration, defense behavior and thermoregulation. These two species are phylogenetically very close (forming the group of giant honey bees, Megapis) and they occupy different ecological niches: <em>A. dorsata</em> is widely distributed over the Asian tropics whereas <em>A. laboriosa</em> is mostly endemic to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas. A few comparative studies performed so far suggest that both species differ in many aspects but still the biology of these giant honey bees is poorly understood. In my first AWS, I will talk about the different approaches we will take to systematically explore the possible adaptations in these honey bees. One of them is quantification of morphological differences in the peripheral olfactory and visual system i.e., gross-morphological analysis of antennae, eyes and ocelli of <em>A. dorsata</em>&nbsp;and <em>A. laboriosa</em>&nbsp;workers and drones. The other approach is comparative transcriptomics to investigate the differences in antennal gene expression in <em>A. dorsata</em> and <em>A. laboriosa</em> from different regions of India.</p> <br> Investigating the role of STIM1 and Store Operated Calcium Entry (SOCE) in mouse Purkinje neurons </br><br><p>Calcium ions are a universal second messenger that regulate various processes, such as proliferation, gene transcription, contraction, exocytosis, apoptosis, immune responses and neurotransmission. Store-Operated Calcium Entry (SOCE) is a major mechanism for calcium mobilizationin in many non-excitable and some excitable cells. Store-operated channels (SOCs) open in response to depletion of calcium in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) after stimulation of cell surface receptors coupled to G-proteins and tyrosine kinases. Store-operated channels (SOCs) consists of the pore-forming Orai proteins that are activated by the ER Calcium sensor STIM (stromal interaction molecule). In the mature brain, store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) is thought to be required for the maintenance of neuronal calcium homeostasis, which in turn can influence synaptic transmission and plasticity. However, the status of SOCE through STIM/Orai activation and its relevance to mammalian cerebellar neuron function are not well studied. Studies have proposed that deranged calcium signalling cascade in cerebellar Purkinje neurons might leads to neuronal degeneration and Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA). We have used Mouse Purkinje neurons as a mammalian &nbsp;model system to understand how STIM1 modulate neuronal function and how altered function of STIM1 leads to neurodegeneration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In this AWS, I will be presenting some of the preliminary work done in wild and STIM1 knock out murine model system. I will share experiments standarised to measure calcium responses in cultured purkinje neurons. I shall also present some preliminary data on behavioral assay standarised to test and compare the motor learning and coordination in wild and STIM1 knock out mice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br> Studying the role of proteostasis of actin modulators in dendritic growth </br><br><p>Dendrite morphogenesis is a critical step in neurodevelopment where the basic architecture of the cellular computational machinery of a neuron is laid out. It is known that various external cues like trophic factors influence dendrite growth; and actin cytoskeletal rearrangement is indispensable to bring about these effects. In other neuronal compartments like axonal growth cones and mature dendritic spines, it has been shown that many proteins involved in actin dynamics are subjected to protein synthesis regulation in response to external cues. But it is not known whether growing dendrites employ similar mechanism of translational regulation, and which candidate proteins are involved. We hypothesized that actin modulator proteins could be undergoing translational regulation in growing dendrites and examined the translational profile of potential candidates in immature neurons in culture.</p>
<p>We identified LIMK1 as one of the candidates and found that translation of its mRNA is upregulated on treatment with trophic factor BDNF. Since LIMK1 is the kinase which phosphorylates a key actin binding protein cofilin, we studied how BDNF influences cofilin phosphorylation. We found that cofilin phosphorylation-which is a measure of its activity- was affected by BDNF in a translation dependent manner. Interestingly neither the translational profile of cofilin mRNA, nor its protein level were affected by BDNF. Our imaging experiments show that these activity changes are somato-dendritic and not axonal. Our data further suggests that cofilin activity is a key juncture in actin rearrangement and is regulated by translation/degradation balance of its regulators. We are currently exploring what this could mean physiologically in the context of dendritic growth.</p> <br> Role of PABPC1 in cell-matrix adhesions </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Cells interact with the extracellular matrix(ECM) via complex structures&nbsp;known as focal adhesions(FAs).Adhesions originate at the leading edge of a&nbsp;spreading or migrating cell. These are dot-like immobile and short lived&nbsp;structures involving proteins like vinculin, paxillin etc. These finally&nbsp;mature to form focal adhesions which are different from nascent adhesions&nbsp;due to their larger size, localization and involvement of additional&nbsp;proteins like tensin and zyxin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />PABPC1, an RNA binding protein, present only in eukaryotes is known to&nbsp;mainly bind Poly A tails of mRNA. It is involved in translation<br />regulation, RNA stability and other processes that decide fates of RNA.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Preliminary data suggest PABPC1 is recruited at the cell periphery during&nbsp;FA maturation and in the leading edges of migrating keratinocytes.&nbsp;Consequently, shRNA mediated knockdown of PABPC1 resulted in significant&nbsp;reduction of FA length and number with increased peripheral&nbsp;distribution.This implicated a role for local translation in FA as PABPC1&nbsp;is an essential regulator of global translation. Interestingly however,&nbsp;knockdown of the protein has not affected the translation directly. It&nbsp;might have rather affected the stability of the transcripts in the cell.Keratinocytes having slow FA dynamics serves as a good model to study the&nbsp;processes regulating FA dynamics.</p> <br> Determination of FAT10 structure by NMR Spectroscopy and molecular insight into FAT10 mediated degradation </br><br><p>Ubiquitin Proteasome system (UPS) regulates protein levels by degrading various types of proteins such as cell cycle regulators, transcription factors, metabolic enzymes etc. These protein gets modified with a transferable degradation signal, such as ubiquitin (Ub) forming K48-linked poly-Ub chains, via ubiquitin conjugation mechanism. Among the several known Ubiquitin like modifiers (ULMs), only FAT10, Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-F Adjacent Transcript 10, acts as degradation signal independent of ubiquitin. Unlike ubiquitin where poly-UB (K48) chains takes the substrate to proteasome, a single moiety of FAT10 is potent enough to bring the substrate to the 26S proteasome. Despite being identified as direct degradation signal more than a decade ago, the structure of FAT10 and its mechanism for degradation is still unknown.</p>
<p>Our interest focuses on understanding the mechanism of FAT10 degradation for which structure determination is vital. We have used NMR spectroscopy for the structural and dynamical studies. So far, we have finished the backbone assignment from the NMR data. We have also compared the stability of FAT10 with Ubiquitin via Guanidium hydrochloride-mediated unfolding and found that FAT10 is quite unstable as the free energy required to unfold FAT10 is less than Ubiquitin. We have also compared the thermal stability of FAT10 with ubiquitin.</p>
<p>In the near future, the ongoing NMR experiments (NOEs) for distance restrains would help us to solve the tertiary structure of FAT10. In addition, we are also investigating E2-FAT10 conjugation mechanism.</p> <br> A visual-olfactory Virtual Reality arena to understand targeted search behaviour </br><br><p>Finding food is necessary for all motile organisms but it is not easy. Most living things are flying insects and they are solitary, living in an ever changing environment and have short lives. For them, all they are left with is their guts. They rely on their sensory cues, primarily vision, olfaction and mechanosensation. But these individual sensory cues are by themselves ambiguous and insufficient to find objects in a complex world. There are many red and round objects which aren&rsquo;t apples and many fruits have similar volatile composition. But their combinations such as red round object with fruity compounds is almost always an apple making the search object more distinct. But to understand how do they combine these cues, tackle ambiguity due to the stochasticity in the environment and make decisions on the &ldquo;fly&rdquo; about their &ldquo;fly&rdquo;ight path we need 3 things. Precise knowledge of what they perceive (the input), what they do in response to that (the output) and finally one needs to be capable of manipulating the ground rules of the environment (the control) at every instant in time. To achieve these 3 demands we've built a virtual reality arena which can give arbitrary and realistic visual, olfactory and mechanosensory input to a tethered fly. What the fly perceives depends on its behavioral output measured from its wings. And the rules of the environment are controlled by the experimenter. Using this, we are trying to understand the algorithms used by the fly during its decision making process as it searches for its object of affection.</p> <br> Discovery of small RNAs in Mycobacteria using covariance model </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">RNAs play numerous and vital roles in a cell, including the regulation of gene expression Their functions are often mediated through interactions with their protein partners, which harbour one or more RNA binding domains (RBDs). A wide spread RNA binding domain from bacteria, called ANTAR (AmiR and NasR Transcriptional Anti-termination Regulator) recognizes a specific structural motif in leader regions of target RNAs. Previously, an ANTAR domain containing protein, EutV in Enterococcus faecalis was shown to regulate the ethanolamine utilization (eut) operon via its target RNA. RNA-binding is triggered by ethanolamine dependent phosphorylation and subsequent dimerization of EutV. Interaction between EutV and RNA disrupts transcription terminators within the leader region of the eut operon, thus allowing the transcription of downstream genes (Ramesh et al., 2012). Interestingly, ANTAR-domain containing proteins are spread across &gt;990 species with 49 different architectures (Pfam v31.0) and yet the role of ANTAR based regulation and the RNA targets of these proteins are not elucidated in many organsims such as Mycobacteria, Pseudomonas, etc. Here we aim to identify RNA targets and cellular pathways that associate with ANTAR in Mycobacteria.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We applied a covariance based search (using Infernal v1.0.2) to all completely sequenced (28) mycobacterial species. We found that these predicted ANTAR RNAs from 128 strains, might regulate 27 unique transcription units present downstream in cis, some of which we validated as binding partners for the mycobacterial ANTAR protein. The knockout of ANTAR protein in M. tuberculosis H37Rv, Rv1626, shows that the gene is essential for in vitro growth on cholesterol (Griffin et al., PLoS pathogens, 2011), which indicates that ANTAR-mediated gene regulation might be related to lipid and cholesterol metabolism. We also observe that some of the predicted ANTAR RNAs in Mycobacteria have the conserved dual hairpin secondary structure but many of these RNA targets have variations in this motif. This indicates that the tool is able to predict RNA targets which is similar to input seed alignment. To improve the seed alignment we have performed clustering of the input seed sequences to remove the extreme outliers. In future, we want to optimize the clustering method to incorporate sequences which can predict RNA targets given any organism (eg. Organisms containing low GC content, medium GC or high GC content). Also, organisms such as Mycobacteria where the predictions for promoters and terminators is poor, we want to predict these using Infernal, looking at the leader sequences of the conserved operons predicted to have the RNA targets. Moreover, Infernal so far has been implemented to predict cis-acting RNAs. We want to implement this to predict trans-acting RNAs such as siRNAs, miRNAs, given that there are hardly any tools which predicts high confidence secondary structures for these RNAs.</p> <br> Hydrodynamic Description of Epithelial Sheet Morphology </br><br><p>Morphology, in the context of early embryo development, is often associated with an archetypal tissue: single-thickness sheets of Epithelial cells, tightly bound together by Cadheren proteins. Deformations of such tissues are primarily generated by Myosin motors acting on the dense Actin meshwork that underpins the Apical surface of the individual Epithelial cells. In this talk, I will describe&nbsp;a (fully covariant) active-hydrodynamic theory that models&nbsp;the dynamics of such tissues, and their associated shape changes. Amongst other results, the work reveals a generic contractile instability that is mediated by deformation of the tissue, leading to features reminiscent of the midgut invagination observed during gastrulation in Drossophila.</p> <br> Understanding the factors affecting evolution of host-microbiome interaction in dragonflies </br><br><p>Recent years have seen an explosion of studies demonstrating crucial role of microbiota on host fitness and vice-versa. However it is unclear how such a stochastic evolutionary process leads to a stable association between a host and its microbiome. The knowledge about these interactions are partially limited due the fact that studies are predominantly performed in laboratory, thus often neglecting the effects of natural ecological forces. Hence in this study we have addressed the effect of host identity (an umbrella term for host associated factors: diet, physiology, genetics), geographical location and seasonality on the gut-associated microbiota in a generalist predatory insect&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; dragonflies. We have used metagenomics, F-ISH and qPCR to examine the microbial community structure. We have also applied metagenomics to understand the potential influence of host diet on the gut-microbiome. The results indicate that all the ecological factors contribute significantly in shaping the microbiome, host-identity being the dominant element.</p> <br> Studying Folding and Unfolding of Mouse Prion Protein Using Single Molecule Spectroscopy </br><br><p>&nbsp;Prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) is a cell surface glycoprotein which is ubiquitously found in the neurons of central nervous system. Normal PrP<sup>C</sup> can be conformationally converted into infectious forms of prion known as PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is associated with various neurodegenerative diseases such as Creutzfeldt&ndash;Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstmann&ndash;Str&auml;ussler&ndash;Scheinker syndrome (GSS) and fatal familial insomnia (FFI).</p>
<p>&nbsp;Although thermodynamic studies have been carried out on variants of PrP<sup>C</sup>, they have relied on ensemble measurements of anchorless PrP<sup>C</sup> (lacking GPI anchor). Such studies have indicated the presence of intermediates which are formed during unfolding process and these intermediates have been shown to have propensity to aggregate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;We propose to carry out equilibrium unfolding studies, on double labelled (with Alexa dyes) anchorless mouse Prion Protein (moPrP) and double labelled moPrP immobilised on a membrane, by using single molecule spectroscopy. We have carried out preparative steps which involves purification, labelling and characterisation of the proteins (moPrP<sup>N143C/S231C</sup> and moPrP<sup>Y155C/N197C</sup>). These preparative steps are essential in order to carry out single molecule experiments in the near future.</p> <br> Complex light sensing in simple eyed flatworms </br><br><p>Light sensing has independently evolved multiple times under diverse selective pressures but has been examined only in a handful among the millions of light-responsive organisms. Unsurprisingly, mechanistic insights into how differential light processing can cause distinct behavioral outputs are limited. We have shown that planarian flatworms (Schmidtea mediterranea) can perform complex processing using their simple eyes. Although planarian flatworms lack wavelength-specific eye photoreceptors, a 25 nm change in light wavelength is sufficient to completely switch their phototactic behavior. Mechanistic studies have shown that planarians have ability to sense even small changes in the amount of light absorbed at the eye, and are then able to convert these &lsquo;effective light intensity changes into clear behavioral outputs. The remarkable ability of planarians to regenerate provides us a unique opportunity to observe and quantify eye brain network regeneration and correlate this to the recovery of their functional ability. Currently we are designing new methods to image and analyze the changes in neural network. Preliminary imaging studies have shown a marked increase in planarian brain synaptic density over the course of regeneration. Also, there is a clear increase in the number of photoreceptor cells and commensurate enhancement and patterning of the rhabdomeric structures. I will present new results showing how photoreceptor cells grow and pattern over eye regeneration. These methods for imaging eye and visual network components offer a great platform to screen for new molecules that regulate eye growth, patterning and function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apart from eye based light sensing, planarians also show a &ldquo;reflex-like,&rdquo; eye-independent (extraocular/whole-body) response to low ultraviolet A light (but not to visible light), apart from the eye-brain&ndash;mediated (ocular) response. This mode of light sensing in planarians is distinct from the more processive ocular sensing. Extraocular or eye-independent light sensing has been reported in many other different organisms, including recent examples like Drosophila larvae, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Platynereis. This whole-body response seems to be conserved in many different planarian species and our experiments suggest the involvement of an opsin protein, which is expressed all over the planarian body. Planarians with two distinct light sensing modalities provide us with exciting opportunities to study interaction and dynamics between them. Overall, our work shows novel light sensing and processing in flatworms, and provides new insights into eye and brain regeneration and patterning.</p> <br> Dynamic expression of tRNA-derived small RNAs define cellular states </br><br><p>Transfer RNA (tRNA)-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) have recently emerged as important regulators of protein translation and shown to have diverse biological functions. However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of tsRNA function in the context of dynamic cell-state transitions remain unclear. In this study, we&nbsp;identified of a set of tsRNAs upregulated in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Mechanistic analyses revealed primary functions of tsRNAs in regulating polysome assembly and translation. Notably, interactome studies with differentially-enriched tsRNAs revealed a switch in associations with &lsquo;effector&rsquo; ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) and &lsquo;target&rsquo; mRNAs in different cell-states. In specific, we probed the effects of tsRNA interaction with an RNA binding protein, Igf2bp1. Our data suggets a regulatory role for tsRNAs in&nbsp;influencing the transcript stability and hence translation&nbsp;of the pluripotency-promoting factor-c-Myc, thereby providing evidence for tsRNAs in modulating stem cell-states in mESCs.</p> <br> Understanding the role of Snail in maintaining the undifferentiated state of epithelial cells </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">A tumour is composed of a heterogeneous population of cells wherein only a few cells that maintain their undifferentiated state can give rise to a de novo tumour. These undifferentiated cells possess features like increased self-renewal capacity, inhibition to differentiation cues and resistance to chemotherapy. This population of undifferentiated cells is widely thought to be the major cause of relapse and poor prognosis. Hence, targeting this small population of undifferentiated cells among the large pool of cellular heterogeneity represents one of the major challenges in cancer therapeutics. To overcome this obstacle, there is a pressing need to understand how these cells maintain their undifferentiated characteristics to develop modalities for inhibiting this process. One possible candidate protein that can mediate this process is a transcription factor, Snail. Although it has long been associated with cancer, recent studies have shown that Snail expression correlates with the maintenance of stem cell like phenotype in cancer initiating cells. However, the mechanism by which Snail accomplishes this remains unknown.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Interestingly, we recapitulated this phenomenon using a transgenic mouse, where Snail is overexpressed in the basal layer of the epidermis.&nbsp;&nbsp;Characterization of the transgenic skin reveals many hallmarks of cancer. In my previous AWS, I had shown that Snail overexpression in keratinocytes is sufficient to endow cells with certain characteristics of epidermal progenitor / undifferentiated cells. Using the Snail transgenic mouse model, my data suggests that one of the secreted proteins from the transgenic cells called Mindin acts in an autocrine fashion to activate STAT3. Also, from the literature it is known that activation of STAT3 is important to maintain the stemness of both embryonic stem cells as well as the cancer stem cells. Although, the kinase that activates STAT3 downstream of Mindin is unknown. Moreover, preliminary data suggests that activation of STAT3 in Snail expressing keratinocytes could occur through the combination of the JAK/STAT pathway and the Src family of kinases. Thus, this Mindin mediated STAT3 activation in Snail expressing cells could be a novel pathway for the maintenance of the undifferentiated state in this epithelial cancer like cell population.</p> <br> Using sugar-elicited search behaviour to study path integration and visual landmark learning in Drosophila melanogaster </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Food search paradigms can be used to study navigation and its components. Sugar elicited search behaviour, is a particular form of local search. Typical search behaviour is initiated after consumption of a small amount of sugar solution by a hungry fly. The behaviour is characterized by high turning rate during walking and making returns to the location of sugar drop. Our experiments indicate that flies return to the location of sugar drop, even in the absence of visual and chemosensory information. This indicates that flies can use path integration to find their way back to the sugar drop. Presence of visual cues in the arena modulates the search behaviour and flies show signs of learning. We are exploring the role of visual landmarks in guiding navigation during the search. Preliminary experiments show that flies may be learning the geometry of landmarks. Sugar elicited search could be used as an experimental assay to study the neural and molecular mechanisms underlying navigation The regions of the fly brain involved in the search behaviour can be identified using the Drosophila neuorogenetic toolkit.</p> <br> Role of Synaptic plasticity in the Purkinje neuron of the cerebellum during in vivo motor adaptation task </br><br><p>Sensorimotor activities require precise motor coordination by the nervous system. This coordination is carried out by the cerebellum. <g class="gr_ gr_75 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="75" data-gr-id="75">Mammalian</g> cerebellum has a layered structure consisting of three layers namely molecular layer (ML), Purkinje cell layer (PCL) and granule cell layer (GCL).

They have been shown to mediate communication between different cell types such as immune cells, mesenchymal stem cells and cancer cells. TNTs have the ability to transfer cellular organelles such as mitochondria, vesicles as well as proteins. They are also known to play an important role in transmission of viruses and Prion proteins leading to disease progression.Despite the various known functions, the mechanisms regulating their formation are as yet unknown. To probe the question of TNT biogenesis, I will be using wound healing as a model system where different stress factors and inflammatory cytokines can be potential inducers of TNTs.&nbsp; Using a genetic model of wound healing based on the conditional deletion of epidermal caspase-8, I have found that factors secreted by the caspase8 KO mouse skin result in an increase in TNT numbers in dermal fibroblasts in vitro. &nbsp;Analysis of the formed TNTs shows that the cell-to-cell connections transport cell organelles including mitochondria. &nbsp;Actin and microtubule which are associated with TNTs play an important role in the number of TNTs formed by Caspase 8 KO CM. &nbsp;In addition the TNT numbers is dependent on secretory vesicle formation suggesting that secretory vesicle derived membranes are necessary for the TNTs structures. &nbsp;In the future I will identify the factors secreted from the wound-like skin and dissect the intracellular signalling cascade leading to TNT biogenesis.&nbsp; This is particularly useful as it has been shown that in certain types of cancers there is an increase in the number of TNTs that leads to resistance to treatments, therefore understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying TNT biogenesis can help in finding possible targets for cancer treatment.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;<strong></strong></p> <br> Understanding behavioral deficits in rat models of Autism Spectrum Disorder </br><br><p>Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) have been shown to have a strong genetic basis with multiple genes implicated in different cellular functions. Rodent models of autism (primarily mouse) have several studies looking at deficits in learning and memory, social behaviour, anxiety, attention deficit etc. all phenotypes modelling human patient symptoms.</p>
<p>In our lab we have several new Rat models of ASD like Fragile X Syndrome (<em>Fmr1)</em>, <em>PTEN</em>, <em>CNTNAP2</em>, <em>Neuroligin</em> 3, <em>Neurexin</em> 1 etc. In this AWS, I shall discuss my results of experiments probing distinct domains of deficits: <strong>Emotional Learning</strong> <strong>and Memory</strong> as well as <strong>Anxiety</strong>- both pathologically relevant domains; in the <em>Fmr1</em> KO model. Emotional Learning and Memory deficits have been probed with the traditional paradigm of Auditory Fear Conditioning, while Anxiety, both innate and stress-induced has been looked at, using a traditional Open-field assay.</p> <br> Role Of Vinculin in Regulating Bulge Stem Cell Quiescence </br><br><p>The ability of stem cells (SCs) to successfully interact with the external environment is critical for their fate determination (for example responses such as differentiation and proliferation). However, how stem cells sense signals from the extracellular matrix (ECM) and how they respond to these signals at the molecular level, (which eventually regulate their fate) is still unexplored in the field. Cells typically sense and transmit mechanical signals to specialized structures like cytoskeletal networks. These structures then transduce the force into a biochemically detectable signal, and ultimately the cell responds by changes in transcription in the nucleus. These are commonly referred to as mechanotransmission, mechanosensing, and mechanoresponse, respectively or as a whole mechanotransduction. Two putative processes which regulate the mechanotransduction of the stem cells or any cell per se with its niche are, the cadherins mediated adherens junctions with its neighboring cell and the integrins mediated focal adhesion with the ECM. Vinculin, a mechano-transducing protein is found both at cell-cell (adherens) junctions and cell substratum (focal) adhesions where it links the actin cytoskeleton to the cell junctions. Previous studies of constitutive knock-out (KO) of vinculin in mouse showed embryonic lethality with defects in cell adhesion and migration highlighting its importance in embryonic development. Earlier analysis has shown variable expression of vinculin in bulge stem cells of the hair follicle, which is the main pool of quiescent stem cells in the skin. However, the mechanical force transduction role of vinculin in maintaining the SCs in their niche via both &ldquo;outside-in&rdquo; and &ldquo;inside-out&rdquo; signaling is largely unexplored. We have generated the vinculin KO in skin epidermis and preliminary analysis of the KO revealed that they exhibited an accelerated hair follicle cycle devoid of the telogen (or resting phase) due to the loss of stem cell quiescence. The objective of this study is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which vinculin maintains the bulge stem cells in their niche and how it contributes to quiescence. We propose to isolate bulge stem cells from WT and KO animals and perform transcriptional profiling to identify pathways that are altered in the absence of vinculin. These data will help us to understand how the absence of vinculin affects the interaction of stem cell and its niche. This study will provide us with a better understanding of the development and homeostasis of tissues and organs that experience and generate mechanical forces, and the role of stem cells in regenerating these tissues.</p> <br> Interaction of Chromium with Microbacterium arborescens, a plant endophyte </br><br><p>Heavy metals in soil is increasing due to geological and anthropogenic activities. Bio- or Phyto- remediation of contaminated soils wherein microorganisms or plants are used for remediation respectively are attractive alternate strategies for ecosystem cleanup as these methods are environment-friendly with no waste by products and cost effective. A few plants are known to thrive in metal contaminated soils. <em>Ricinus communis</em> (Castor bean plant), a heavy metal accumulator, grows well in contaminated areas. Chromium(Cr) tolerant endophytes were isolated from the leaves of this plant growing in metal polluted soils in Bengaluru. Based on 16S sequencing, one of the isolates was identified as <em>Microbacterium arborescens</em> and its <em>in vitro</em> interaction with Cr was studied in aqueous system. At pH 1, incubating 5x1010 cells/ml for 2.5 hours with an initial Cr(VI) concentration of 10ppm led to 100% bioremoval. Bioreduction to Cr(III) contributed to 70% decrease in Cr(VI). Bioremoval upto 150 ppm Cr was tested. Extra-cellular secretion from late stationary phase of <em>M. arborescens</em> was also shown to reduce Cr (VI). <em>M. arborescens</em> showed reduced lag phase when adapted to 15 ppm Cr- supplemented medium. Further, we checked the effect of Cr on the germination and growth of <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em>. Future studies would involve understanding how <em>M. arborescens</em> affects the response of <em>A. thaliana</em> under Cr stress.</p> <br> Egr-1:Â A Molecular Player Involved In Time-related Memory In Honey Bees? </br><br><p>Honey bees have been a successful model system to study diverse learning and memory processes under free flying conditions and in restrained lab assays. They have been shown to possess astonishing cognitive capabilities like learning time, colour, odour, location etc. of the food source. Since, foragers can be trained to forage at an artificial feeder, we used the foraging behaviour to identify specific molecular processes involved in learning and memory in a natural context.</p>
<p>Honey bee foragers were time-trained to an artificial feeder for several days in an outdoor flight cage and collections were made at different time points as per the experimental requirement. The RNA levels of different genes were measured using qPCR.</p>
<p>Honeybees foraging at an already known feeder showed a long lasting up-regulation of three immediate early genes (Egr-1, Hr38, kakusei) and also an up-regulation of candidate downstream genes involved in dopamine ecdysone signalling pathway (EcR,Ddc, DopEcR). Also, Egr-1 mRNA levels were significantly up-regulated at the time of feeder training compared to time points before and after feeder training, when the feeder was not presented. Based on this finding, we hypothesized that the Egr-1 expression might be under the regulations of the circadian clock. To test this, we prevented the time-trained foragers from leaving the hive using the artificial rain paradigm. In these experiments, we also observed a significant but lower up-regulation of Egr-1 around the time of feeder training. Together our results indicate two different genomic responses occurring during daily foraging: (a) continuous daily foraging induces a genomic response mediated by immediate early genes like Egr-1, Hr38 and kakusei. This genomic response can be involved in learning and memory processes as well as cellular homeostasis; and (b) time-training results in an anticipatory up-regulation of Egr-1and hence could be a molecular player involved in time-related memory processes.</p> <br> Spectral properties of Sandercyanin fluorescent protein </br><br><p>Sandercyanin is a 18kDa protein found in the fish <em>Sander vitreous.</em>It forms a complex with biliverdin which is a product of heme degradation.Sandercyanin undergoes ligand(biliverdin) induced tetramerization and forms a noncovalent interaction with the ligand.</p>
<p>The complex of Sandercyanin -biliverdin absorbs at 375 nm and fluorescence peak is observed at 675 nm which corresponds to a spectral shift of 300 nm.Hence to account for such a large spectral shift Raman spectroscopy will be used.</p>

Though the arrest is important for proper organogenesis, the mechanisms underlying this arrest are poorly understood. Progenitors of the adult thoracic tracheal system in <em>Drosophila</em> are arrested in G2 for about 56 hrs during larval life (through L2 and early L3) and re-enter mitosis (M) by 32-40 hrs into L3. Studies in the lab show that hyperfused mitochondria and active ATR-CHK1 mediate G2 arrest by inhibiting Cdc2, the Cyclin-dependent Kinase that drives G2-M. My work focuses on the role of ecdysteroid signalling on the regulation of G2 arrest. A genetic screen to dissect the mechanisms of G2 arrest is also in progress.</p> <br> Spatial and Temporal Organization of Microtubule Post-translational Modification (PTMs) </br><br><p>Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of tubulins regulate various microtubule organizations during cell division, cell migration and polarization, muscle contraction and intracellular transport of molecules. Being a dynamic polymer, microtubules undergo several remodellings in its organization to regulate intracellular cargo trafficking. However, the inability to study these PTMs in-vivo has limited our knowledge in understanding their physiological significance. Here, we have designed epitopes mimicking the PTMs on &alpha; and &beta; tubulins and screened to find high-affinity binding proteins from yeast display library of SSO7D protein (Gera et al., 2013, 2011). These binders against specific modifications can be used inside the living cells to unravel the spatial-temporal organization of microtubule PTMs and their influence in regulating microtubule motors. Currently, my work focuses on establishing interactions between the binders screened from this library for recognizing microtubules modified with tyrosination, detyrosination and glutamylation. These modifications are highly enriched on stable microtubules and have been shown to affect the activity of several microtubule motors.</p> <br> Scaling of patterns during tissue morphogenesis </br><br><p>Patterns formed in organisms, especially during development are clasically explained by either reaction-diffusion equations (Turing patterns) or ligand-mediated gene expression (Wolpert's French Flag model). While being successful in explaining the patterns seen in biological systems, these mathematical models lack a fundamental symmetry that is observed in living systems -invariance of patterns upon scaling or in other words, scale invariance. There has been growing interest in explaining this symmetry in a mathematical model. There is a need for a theory for this phenomenon.&nbsp;</p> <br> Octopamine receptors on central brain dopaminergic neurons regulate flight durations in Drosophila melanogaster </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;"><em></em>Insect flight is a complex behaviour that requires the integration of multiple sensory inputs with the motor output. Flight defects can arise from either the inability to sense stimuli, from incorrect information processing in the interneurons or due to malfunctions in the motor output. Here we have studied a catecholaminergic circuit, that helps integrate different sensory cues in the central brain. This circuit sustains longer flight durations, essential for reaching fresh sources of food, finding a mate and identifying suitable places for depositing eggs in the fly&rsquo;s natural environment. Previous studies have shown that Drosophila flight can be modulated by monoamines like octopamine, dopamine and serotonin as well as several neuropeptides. Octopamine, analogous to vertebrate norepinephrine, act as a neuromodulator as well as a neurotransmitter in invertebrates. Flies lacking octopamine fly for shorter durations even though their flight muscles appear normal1. There are approximately 100 octopaminergic neurons that innervate multiple regions of Drosophila brain. Earlier we had shown that maintenance of flight for long durations requires the Protocerebral Anterior Medial (PAM) cluster of central dopaminergic neurons2. Here we have identified a requirement for specific octopaminergic inputs to the PAM cluster. PAM neurons in turn project to the Mushroom Body (MB), a higher integrating centre in insect brain. Our data support a model where this octopaminergic&shy;dopaminergic circuit integrates sensory information to help generate a contextually relevant flight motor output. In a broader context, this flight circuit functions like the vertebrate circuit where basal ganglia (BG) act as an action selection centre based on the inputs received from different regions of the brain, mainly the cortex3. Our studies reveal that MB also acts as a context dependent action selection centre like BG in addition to its role in learning and memory, which results in a motor output, here this being longer flight durations.<br />References:<br />1.

The role of the actin cytoskeleton in affecting dynamics and nano-clustering of GPI anchored proteins (GPI-AP) and trans-membrane proteins with an actin binding domain (TmABD) has been elucidated in past studies. Both theoretical (Gowrishankar et al., Cell 2012) and in vitro experimental studies (Koester et al., PNAS 2016) indicated that dynamic actin filaments driven into an aster-like configuration by myosin motors are involved in nano-clustering and organizing proteins on the membrane. However it is not understood whether cells adopt a similar strategy and which class of myosin motors might execute the function in cells.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated the role of non-muscle myosins and how they affect the organization of GPI-APs and TmABD proteins. We have identified a role for class I myosins in driving nanoclustering of the lipid anchored GPI-APs and class II myosins in organizing TmABD proteins at the plasma membrane. Interestingly, class I myosins do not affect the clustering of TmABD proteins and class II myosins do not affect clustering of the GPI-APs. A plausible explanation is that outer-leaflet lipid-anchored GPI-APs need membrane-bound class I myosins to generate a contractile actin machinery close to the membrane, whereas, actin binding TmABD proteins rely on a myosin II generated pool of contractile actin filaments for nano-clustering.</p>
<p>Thus, we identify a cytoskeletal machinery by which cells can selectively organize different classes of membrane molecules, either lipid-anchored or trans-membrane actin binding proteins.</p> <br> Subcellular mechanisms of varying timescales discrimate spatiotemporal signals </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp;In many forms of brain activity, ensembles of neurons fire sequentially representing features of sensory stimuli, motor patterns, or internal computations. Hippocampal neurons exhibit sequential activity when animals are traversing a linear track, during replay events, trace conditioning and associative learning. In order to understand neuronal processing for such diverse functional inputs at a single neuron level, here we present a modeling study that focuses on computation of the sequences of varying time-scales. To examine how sequence computations may take place over multiple time-scales, we have implemented abstract models of different subcellular mechanisms and studied their interactions in discriminating input sequences that vary in time and space. Selectivity of electrical (Branco et al., 2010) and chemical (Bhalla, 2016) signaling mechanisms for sequential inputs was shown previously. Apart from the forementioned mechanisms we are also introducing an electrochemical signaling (Calcium Induced Calcium Release; CICR) to address the sequence discrimination. We hypothesize that combinations of active time-windows of these mechanisms could facilitate the sequence recognition for a wider timespan (milliseconds to seconds), however, our abstract model has captured a non-continuous selectivity ranges in time. Attempts at modeling detailed multiscale multicompartmental model of pyramidal neuron including subcellular mechanisms (electrical, electrochemical and chemical) and study the plausible time-invariance sequence recognition are ongoing.</p> <br> No AWS. </br><br><p>Wrong AWS</p> <br> The Mechanics of Cell Surface Clusters and Their Role in Signalling </br><br><p>We study the role of non-equilibrium processes in generating functional clusters of proteins and lipids at the cell surface. Starting from a coarse-grained description of dynamic actin filaments and myosin motor minifilament in the cortex, we analyse the formation and dynamics of emergent structures that serve as templates for clusters on the plasma membrane. These results are compared with recent <em>in vitro</em> experiments. We then go on to analyse the contribution of non-equilibrium mechanisms to biological function at the cell surface; specifically, we look at how the breaking of detailed balance in (a) the physical process of clustering, and (b) the chemical process of signalling at a cluster may be exploited by the cell. The latter is discussed in the context of recent <em>in vivo</em> experiments on early events in T-cell signalling.</p>
<p>In this pre-submission seminar, I will provide context for this work, and go on to briefly describe my methods and results.</p>

The thick filament contains a three start helical array of myosins spaced 43 nm apart. It is estimated that in a half-sarcomere upto 50 myosin molecules are available for each thin filament. Evidence from cardiac muscle physiology during beta-adrenergic response or in diseased hypertrophic heart suggests that hypercontractility can be achieved by increasing the availability of myosins. A long standing question here is how many muscle myosin motors are required for a processive sliding? Is the force generated additive or cooperative with increasing number of motors? While muscle myosins have been extensively studied at single molecule level for years, their ensemble properties have been unexplored, largely due to lack of tools to control topology and number of myosins during biophysical assays. To address this, I aim to take advantage of DNA origami structures that would provide precise attachment sites for myosin motors, which mimics the physiological thick filament arrangement.</p>
<p>The technical challenge here is to engineer myosins that can be attached to DNA. Since the recombinant expression of myosin is non-trivial, we have devised a strategy that will allow me to take endogenous myosin and exchange the regulatory light chain (RLC) with the recombinant version which will facilitate DNA attachment. Until now, I have expressed and purified RLC-SNAP from E. coli, performed exchange reactions with myosin fragments and tested its motor activity. I have also been able to attach these exchanged motors onto the DNA origami structures and show that this &ldquo;reconstituted thick filaments&rdquo; bind to actin via the motors. The assay conditions for the movement of these structures over actin needs to be optimized. &nbsp;Once this method is established, it will serve as a universal tool to attach other muscle myosins to DNA and study their properties. We aim at characterizing the velocity, processivity and dwell time as a function of motor number attached to the DNA scaffold. These biophysical characterizations will be the first to address cooperativity among muscle myosins, a long-standing question in the area of motor biophysics and muscle biology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br> Investigating the role of intracellular calcium signaling in insulin producing neurons (IPCs) for Drosophila flight. </br><br><p>Calcium is a universal secondary messenger which integrates diverse cellular signaling mechanisms. One of the major pathways that mediate calcium signaling inside the cell is IP<sub>3</sub> mediated intracellular calcium signaling. Upon receiving external stimuli through G-Protein Coupled Receptors, IP<sub>3</sub> is generated by hydrolysis of the membrane lipid PIP2. IP<sub>3</sub> formed then binds to IP<sub>3</sub> receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R) and releases calcium from endoplasmic reticular stores. As calcium levels in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) start depleting, they are sensed by STIM (transmembrane protein in ER) which oligomerizes and interacts with Orai (CRAC channel in Plasma membrane) to bring extracellular calcium into cytoplasm. This calcium is then pumped back into ER by SERCA. This mode of calcium entry is known as Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) and is present in excitable and non excitable cells. Calcium signaling in neurons however is more complex as there are more ways of calcium entry than non-excitable cells.<br /> Previous work from our lab has shown that both IP<sub>3</sub> mediated calcium signaling and SOCE in neurons affects <em>Drosophila</em> flight. IP<sub>3</sub>R mutants which are flightless can be rescued for flight by expressing IP<sub>3</sub>R, STIM or Orai in specific neuronal subsets- dopaminergic neurons and insulin like peptides (dILPs) producing neurons. Thus, these IP<sub>3</sub>R mutants serve as an important tool to study these signaling pathways in neurons. Underlying mechanism of rescue through dopaminergic neurons is now known to some extent but that for dILPs neurons is still not understood. dILPs have been found to affect a wide array of <em>Drosophila</em> behaviours including foraging, odor-sensing, feeding, etc. but their role in flight require further studies.<br /> I am investigating the possible effects of dILPs on parts of identified <em>Drosophila</em> flight circuit. A major focus of my work is to understand if rescue of flight through dopaminergic and dILPs neurons involves same neuronal circuit or different parallel circuits. I will present preliminary data from these experiments.</p>

This is widely observed with several &ldquo;unicellular&rdquo; organisms. However, the fundamental metabolic principles underlying the transition of unicellular organisms to specialized communities are poorly explored. We wanted to understand the development of these communities from a metabolism perspective, and explain the organizing principles of such communities. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as our model system, we find that specific amino acids are critical for the development of spatially well-organized cellular communities, with the process itself being dependent upon gluconeogenesis. We show that these communities are not uniformly gluconeogenic, but exhibit distinct, diametrically opposite metabolic states that are spatially very well separated. This community organization not only depends upon the ability of a cell to carry out gluconeogenesis, but also depends upon the ability to switch to an alternate metabolic state. We therefore built a theoretical, physical model to understand the nature of organization leading to the formation of such communities. Our data show that such highly defined communities can emerge through spontaneous self-organization, requiring stochastic switching between metabolic states, as well as interactions between the cells of two distinct states. This provides a general model by which isogenic cell populations can self-organize into specialized communities, driven by key metabolic determinants.</p> <br> Understanding the role of Dopaminergic signalling in Drosophila hematopoiesis </br><br><p>Hematopoiesis is a developmental process that results in the formation of hemocytes (blood cells) which then forms the essential component of an organism's immune system. In this regard, Drosophila hematopoiesis, sharing high similarity with the vertebrate counterpart, serves as an excellent system to study this dynamic phenomena. Various systemic and intrinsic cues have been elucidated that regulate maintenance of the hematopoietic progenitor population harboured by the lymph gland, the hematopoietic organ of Drosophila. Olfaction mediated GABA secretion from brain is known to govern progenitor maintenance highlighting the blood-brain connectivity. The involvement of other neurotransmitters remains unclear. In the lab, we are interested in understanding the neuronal regulation of hematopoiesis. We find that Dopamine could be a potential candidate regulating progenitor differentiation thereby antagonising GABAergic functions. In my AWS, I will discuss my initial findings on how dopaminergic signalling could mediate progenitor differentiation.</p> <br> NA </br><br><p>NA</p> <br> Impacts of global changes on plant invasion in the Shola-Grasslands of the Nilgiris </br><br><p>Invasion by plant species, predicted to increase due to global environmental changes (Jia <em>et al.</em> 2016), is an improtant driver of biodiversity loss. Three of these species, namely&nbsp;<em>Acacia mearnsii</em>,&nbsp;<em>Cytisus scoparius</em> and&nbsp;<em>Ulex europaeus</em>, are threatening the high-altitude Shola-Grassland ecosystem in the Nilgiris.</p>
<p>My PhD work is aimed at understanding how global changes, particularly atmospheric Nitrogen deposition and increasing temperatures, would affect invasion of these species into the Nilgiri grasslands. Since infrequent fires, which can change nutrient dynamics for transient periods, occur in this ecosystem, I also aim to study how fire would interact with N-deposition and warming to affect invasion by these species.</p>
<p>After introducing the ecosystem of interest and setting the context for my research questions, I will talk about my current work aimed at developing preliminary insights on the N-dynamics of this ecosystem. I will end the talk with my future plans. It is hoped that the study would improve management plans for this ecosystem.</p>

While the&nbsp;olfactory system in insects has been relatively well-studied, the role of&nbsp;odorant binding proteins (OBPs) has not been clear. While several odorants&nbsp;and pheromones are able to directly activate olfactory receptors, the&nbsp;sensillary lymph around dendrites abounds in OBPs in the millimolar range (Leal, 2005).<br /> The perception of indole, a chemical in human sweat, by female &nbsp;<em>A. gambiae &nbsp;</em>requires OBP1 (Beissmann et al, 2010) although it has been proposed that&nbsp;formation of interactions between OBP1 &amp; OBP4 may be required for binding&nbsp;to indole (Andronopoulou et al, 2006). I plan to follow previous&nbsp;studies in our lab to identify putative OBPs in three mosquito&nbsp;genomes (Manoharan et al, 2013). In collaboration with Sypros Zographos's group, we plan to perform structural studies on OBPs to&nbsp;investigate pH-dependence in odorant binding and release. We find&nbsp;that as pH reduces, heterodimeric stability reduces, as proposed earlier&nbsp;by Kaissling in 2001. We also found that some of the residues showing high&nbsp;chemical shifts on indole-binding (Davrazou et al, 2011) were detected on the predicted interface&nbsp;in our model.</p>

Further, role of<br />enhancers and non-coding RNAs in these spatio-temporally regulated mechanisms is just emerging. Enhancers<br />are classified based on their length, number and pattern of bound transcription factors and whether or not, they<br />transcribe ncRNA (eRNAs). I am interested in one such type of enhancers characterized by the presence<br />of recruitment of multiple transcription factor in-trans indicative of the co-operative binding behaviour of nuclear<br />receptors and other transcription factors. However, how an enhancer assembles these trans-binding factors and<br />why this plethora of factors are required at first place is not known. Furthermore, these so called functional<br />enhancers show robust induction of non-coding transcripts termed enhancer RNA (eRNA). I hypothesize, since,<br />the only enhancers that show robust induction of eRNAs are megra-trans enhancers thus, eRNAs may play a<br />role in orchestrating the mega-trans assembly and may also help these enhancers achieve long-range<br />interactions with other genomic elements. Using CRISPRi mediated eRNA elongation blocking and LNA-<br />mediated eRNA knockdown approaches, I found that eRNA on TFF1enhancer (One of the most active enhancer)<br />plays a crucial role in the complex assembly. Further, perturbation of Tff1eRNA also abrogates the functionality<br />of distant enhancer and their genes in linear genome. Strongly suggesting, the role of lncRNA (eRNA) in 3D-<br />chromatin architecture. I will also discuss the possible mechanisms for such eRNA functions. In future, I plan to<br />extend this study genome-wide where, I would like to identify the mega-trans proteins that directly bind with<br />eRNA and understand their role in assembly.</p> <br> Computational Implications of Sequence Recognising Neurons in Networks </br><br><p>We encounter sequences in multiple aspects of our daily lives, including speech, music, and motion perception. Language is the most apt example for this. Individual words mean much more to us when they are stitched together in the right order to form a meaningful phrase. The ability to learn ordering relationships between entities and predict certain future events is vital for perception and communication.</p>
<p>Several studies have reported the sequential firing of groups of neurons, associated with the animal performing a task that involves encoding time(1-2). Dr. Upinder Bhalla, in his recent work(3), has shown that individual neurons can discriminate between such sequences of neuronal activity, with the help of reaction-diffusion pathways in dendrites. Hence with the hypothesis that individual neurons could be capable of recognizing sequences, we wish to move forward and explore the computational capabilities of networks containing such sequence recognizing neurons. In order to understand the behaviour of these networks, we have implemented simplified versions of these neurons (that are also computationally fast) which show differential responses to a set of inputs based on the spatio-temporal order in which they arrive. I will also be discussing some of the applications of sequence-recognizing neurons in networks.</p>

Glycans contain biological information essential for cell-cell, cell-matrix, host-pathogen, and receptor-ligand interaction. In this study, we employed a systems approach to understand the role of glycans in planarian S. mediterranea&ndash; a robust and tractable model system to study regeneration. Whole worm N-glycome analysis using MALDI-TOF and TOF/TOF mass spectrometry revealed presence of multiple isomers of N-glycans composed of mono and polyGalactosylated(n=1-5)-fucose attached to the core of high mannose and paucimannose structures. In addition to the multiplicity seen in N-glycome, glycans exhibited further diversity in the form of methylation. Non-methylated glycans were a minor fraction, whereas methylated glycans formed the majority. As galactosylated-fucose was predominant in planarians, we performed in silico analysis to identify GALT-1 (an enzyme essential for Gal&beta;(1-4)Fuc formation) homologs in S. mediterranea. Homology search in planmine database revealed the presence of two GALT-1 homologs. Knockdown (RNAi) of Smed-galt-1 led to homeostatic defects as evidenced by the rare stick and stretch and non-motile phenotypes. Cellular characterization of these phenotypes revealed that knockdown of Smed galt-1 affects cliliary density. The study brings forth three novel aspects a) presence of Gal&beta;1-4Fuc and extended Gal&beta;1-4Fuc at the core of high mannose and paucimannose structure and provide evidence for novel GlcNAc-independent biosynthetic pathway for N-glycans in vivo b) Enormous structural diversity in N-glycans of planarians in the form of multiple isomers and methylation, both put together give rise to more than 60 different N-glycans. c) Presumptive role of Gal&beta;1-4Fuc modified glycans in ciliary organization and homeostasis.</p> <br> Axial polarity cues in vertebrate head mesoderm development </br><br><p>Vertebrate head mesoderm is an important embryonic cell type, which generates heart and skeletal muscles of head. The developmental mechanism underlying the specification of this bi-potent progenitor population is unclear. We hypothesized that early developmental cues, which establish anterior body axis polarity, confer head mesoderm identity. Using differentiation assay we show that Wnt and Nodal inhibition induces head mesoderm markers in nascent mesoderm derived from embryonic stem cells. We demonstrate that the dual inhibition-derived mesoderm differentiates efficiently into skeletal muscle and beating cardiomyocytes, providing a compelling evidence for its head mesoderm identity. Moreover, we show that Wnt inhibition is required for robust head mesoderm development in the mouse embryos. Thus, our results reveal the role of anterior polarity cues in specifying head mesoderm in vertebrates. Our current efforts are aimed at addressing the evolutionary origin of the bi-potent head mesoderm, which is relevant to understand vertebrate evolution. &nbsp;</p> <br> Pre-Synopsis-Submission Seminar:Small GTPases and BAR domain proteins regulate branched actin to make clathrin and dynamin independent endocytic vesicles </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Numerous endocytic pathways operate simultaneously at the cell surface. Our lab focuses on the molecular machinery involved in the generation of endocytic vesicles of the clathrin and dynamin-independent CLIC/GEEC (CG) pathway. This pathway internalises many GPI-anchored proteins and a large fraction of the fluid-phase in different cell types. We have developed a real-time&nbsp;Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy (TIRFM) based assay using pH-sensitive GFP-GPI to identify nascent CG endocytic sites. The temporal profile of known CG pathway modulators showed that ARF1/GBF1 (GTPase/GEF pair) and CDC42 (RhoGTPase) are recruited sequentially to CG endocytic sites, ~60s and ~9s prior to scission. A RNAi screen <g class="gr_ gr_187 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="187" data-gr-id="187">done</g> in <g class="gr_ gr_185 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="185" data-gr-id="185">parallel</g> lead to the identification of several BAR domain proteins affecting CG endocytosis. Among these, I have focused on IRSp53 and PICK1 that have interactions with CDC42 and ARF1 respectively. IRSp53, an Inverse-BAR domain-containing protein,&nbsp;is recruited to the plasma membrane at the site of forming CG endocytic vesicles and in its absence, nascent CG endocytic vesicles, did not form. The requirement for actin polymerization in the CG pathway suggested a role for nucleators of actin polymerization, and ARP2/3 was found enriched at the site of the forming endocytic vesicle. PICK1, a BAR domain-containing protein and the ARP2/3 inhibitor is recruited at an early stage along with ARP2/3 but is removed from the endocytic site coincident with CDC42 recruitment and a burst of F-actin polymerization. Using this assay we show that a medley of BAR domain-containing proteins <g class="gr_ gr_407 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="407" data-gr-id="407">are</g> recruited to the forming endosome in a specific sequence, suggesting a mechanism involving ARP2/3 based actin polymerization in the formation of this pathway.</p>

It is caused when the walls of the left ventricles become abnormally thickened. The thickened wall reduce ventricle chamber, making it harder for the heart to pump blood. Sarcomeric proteins are the major players in the development of HCM. But the presence of significant variability in the phenotypic expression points to an interaction of these genes with other modifier genes. Modifier genes alone are not sufficient to cause HCM, but they affect the severity of the disease significantly. In this study, we aim to investigate the role of modifier genes, which can be used&nbsp; for putative drug targets.&nbsp; We use an integrative approach to identify modifiers.</p> <br> Investigating the role of Kog1/RAPTOR in integrating amino-acid and carbon metabolism </br><br><p>Our understanding of eukaryotic growth comes primarily from how cells grow in nutrient rich conditions, but far less is known about how cells adapt and grow during nutrient limitation. The TORC1 is a master regulator of growth, sensing and integrating multiple nutrient inputs to regulate anabolic outputs. This TORC1 includes both the TOR kinase as well as Kog1/RAPTOR, a major scaffolding protein. However, the roles of Kog1 itself are poorly studied. We have identified an amino-terminal mutant of Kog1, which shows slow adaptation to growth in amino acid deprived conditions, when glucose is not the primary carbon source. We dissect this amino acid dependence, and find that growth in these conditions is specifically rescued by aspartate. This led us to identify amino acid dependent gluconeogenesis to be a major pathway affected in these mutants. The goal of this work is to understand how Kog1 regulates gluconeogenesis and integrates amino-acid and carbon metabolism.</p> <br> Cross talk of two PTMs in HCMV infection: SUMOylation of HCMV Essential Transactivator IE2 is Regulated by CK2 Mediated Phosphorylation </br><br><p>Post translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins modulate their activity and functions. Thereby, PTMs allow cell to fine tune for external stimulus or internal cell-state. Moreover, different PTM players cross talk to bring about concerted effect on cellular condition.&nbsp; PTM by SUMO (Small Ubiquitin like Modifier) has been shown to modulate several cellular pathways. Interestingly, Viruses hijack SUMOylation along with other host cellular pathways for its effective replication and propagation. However, the molecular mechanism and consequence of interplay between SUMOylation and viral proteins are not well understood. Here, we study the mechanism of how immediate early proteins (IE1 and IE2) of Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) interact and utilises host SUMOylation pathway. IE2, an essential immediate early protein, has been shown to get SUMOylated. Abrogating IE2 SUMOylation decreases viral replication. Therefore, it is discernible how an exogenous viral protein uses endogenous SUMOylation pathway to SUMOylate itself for functional advantages. Our results suggest, SUMO Interacting Motif (SIM) adjacent to SUMOylation site in IE2 enhances its SUMOylation. We also found that phosphorylation of IE2 SIM increases its SUMO binding affinity by several folds and in turn increases its SUMOylation. Hereby, we show a cross talk between phosphorylation and sumoylation where phosphorylation of a viral substrate increases it SUMOylation.</p> <br> Molecular mechanism of Lithium sensitivity </br><br><p>Bipolar disorder (BD) is a devastating psychiatric illness characterized by disruptive mood swings; with alteration between mania &amp; depression. Lithium stands out as the go-to drug because of its preventive effect against mania and also for its specific antisuicide effect. Although lithium is still the mainstay in BD treatment, individual response towards lithium is variable- it remains an ineffective course of action for a large proportion of bipolar sufferers- the so-called &lsquo;lithium non-responders&rsquo;, whereas around 30% of patients are only partially responsive to lithium. However, the mechanism of lithium sensitivity still remains partially understood and there are multiple hypotheses in this regard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Studies have shown that the PI cycle is a key intracellular second messenger system in brain- failure to regulate the PI signaling pathway can have devastating consequences on cellular function. One of the widely discussed hypothesis is that lithium affects the hyperactive inositol signaling in the cells by inhibiting Inositol monophosphatase (IMPase) - which is integral to the maintenance of the PI signaling in mammalian cells. The aim of our study is to determine whether perturbing IMPase function induces the beneficial effects of lithium. We plan to revisit the inositol depletion hypothesis via a novel approach using lipid specific fluorescent probes.</p>
<p><em></em></p> <br> Macro-ecological analyses to understand Passerine species-richness gradients in the Himalayas </br><br><p>The Himalayas are amongst the most species-rich regions of the world, harbouring ~8% of the global bird species. Interestingly, there are many more bird species in the South-eastern Himalayas (SEH) than in the North-western Himalayas (NWH).</p>
<p></p>
<p>What explains this decline from SEH to NWH? The answers might lie in understanding how geographical, environmental and ecological barriers have restricted Himalayan bird distributions. For example, physical barriers may limit dispersal of less-mobile forest understory birds more strongly relative to highly-mobile canopy birds. Such barriers may also explain why some species show little diversification across the range from SEH to NWH, while others are distributed as clearly distinct sub-species. Our work aims to integrate macro-ecological and phylogeographic analyses to link the extent of east-west population diversification in select Himalayan bird species to their biology, evolutionary histories and Himalayan rivers as potential physical barriers.</p> <br> Visualizing the organisation and regeneration of planarian eyes </br><br><p>Patterning and evolution of animal eyes is a problem that long fascinated biologists. A comprehensive analysis of eye types suggest important transitions and landmarks as the various eye types evolved, including the highly complex mammalian eye. An important eye-type in this evolution is the simple cup-shaped eye, also referred to as a pit eye. Typically these eyes have encased photoreceptors in a cup or a pit, along with a shielding pigment. While this eye is one of the most common eye type in nature and shares many features with the mammalian eye, very little is known about its patterning and function. Planarian flatworm, which are often studied for their dramatic regeneration potential, possess such simple cup-shaped or pit eyes and offer a fascinating model for eye patterning and function. Planarian eye spots present on the anterior end of the dorsal side are made up of photoreceptor neurons (PRNs) with microvilli projected into a pigment cup. The planarian eye is also a true cerebral eye, connected to a bi-lobed brain through an optic chiasma. Since planarians can fully regenerate their brain and eyes after injury, they offer intriguing possibilities to study eye regeneration and function.</p>
<p>New work from our lab (Shettigar et al 2017) has shown that the &lsquo;simple&rsquo; planarian eye and visual neuronal network is capable of strikingly complex sensing and processing. Planarians are able to compare and discriminate highly similar light inputs and show very clear behavioral outputs. For instance, planarians possess only a single opsin photoreceptor in the brain (have no formal wavelength discrimination ability), but only a 25 nm change in input wavelength completely swtiches their behavior. Using dual-wavelength choice assays, we have shown that planarians are able to convert the intrinsic spectral sensitivity of their eye photoreceptor into virtually binary behavioral outputs. These do that by converting wavelength information into an &lsquo;effective&rsquo; intensity. Planarians are capable of complete regeneration on amputation giving us the opportunity of studying development of eyes repeatedly on decapitation. On decapitation, within 5 days, they are able to avoid light and make coarse choices but the ability to &lsquo;choose&rsquo; between closely separated wavelengths only returns after ~12 days. With robust and highly sophisticated phototactic behaviour observed in the species Schmidtea mediterranea, it is possible to study functional eye regeneration and patterning for the first time.</p>
<p>In this project we wish to study two closely related aspects of planarian vision. We aim to understand the change in structure and patterning of the eyes over regeneration and correlate this to the return of multiple and heirarchical visual behaviours. Our working hypothesis indicates that planarians possess an ability to sense acute light gradients and I am developing behavioral assays to test this model. As planarian eyes are made up of a heterogeneous population of photoreceptors and have an optic chiasma, where photoreceptor neurons (PRNs) send projections across to the other side of the brain, we are also looking into the role of these eye components in function by physical and molecular disruption. We hypothesized that planarians likely need comparative analysis and crosstalk between the left and the right eyes and PRNs for fine discrimination and gradient sensing. Using light gradient sensing assays along with physical and genetic perturbation of PRNs and axonal projections, I am testing this hypothesis. Establishing how simple cerebral eyes are able to sense and process light gradients would constitute a fundamental advance. I am also examining the patterning and development of individual eye components using electron and fluorescence microscopy and then linking specific structural changes with function. Overall this would be a unique new examination of a regenerating animal eye and likely to provide new insights into eye organization and function.</p> <br> Deciphering odor affinities of olfactory receptors through genome-wide survey, molecular modelling and docking studies </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Olfaction is crucial for survival and proliferation of many vertebrate and insect species. These two groups possess two different kinds of Olfactory Receptor (OR) protein families that bind to only specific odorants and define the kind of smells that are perceived by the species.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The structural details of both types of ORs are yet unknown. Hence initially I contributed to the structure prediction of 100 ORs from 5 model organisms. We assessed 17 TMH prediction programs and developed our own Consensus TMH prediction using the three best predictors. The structures modelled with the help TMH predictions are made available at our in-house &lsquo;Database of Olfactory Receptors (DOR)&rsquo; for further studies [1]. Later, we decided to explore the diversity of ORs in few non-model species and study their evolution as probably a consequence of certain stimuli and behaviours. We computationally discovered 180 ORs from the sequenced, but not yet well-annotated, genome of dwarf Asian honey bee <em>Apis florea</em> and compared them to the ORs from the European honey bee <em>Apis mellifera</em>. We classified total ORs into 21 subfamilies and predicted functions for few of them based on the available knowledge on OR-odorant interactions in other Hymenopteran species. In collaboration with Dr. Axel Brockmann&rsquo;s lab, we also compared the transcriptome of male and female antennae from the species and identified putative queen mandibular pheromone (QMP) receptor group of ORs [2]. We noticed that most species studied from insect order Hymenoptera were eusocial and possessed expanded OR genes. Hence we decided to find complete OR gene set from the first sequenced solitary bees <em>Dufourea novaeangliae</em> and <em>Habropoda laboriosa</em> (blueberry bee). We discovered 112 and 151 ORs respectively, more than 100 of which were found at novel loci. We found that the expanded total OR repertoire is not just the result of the degree of eusociality of the insect but might depend on the complex chemical ecology of the species. Among the conserved upstream motifs, one was found to be a candidate master transcription factor binding site for multiple olfactory genes [3]. Recently, we have developed our own &lsquo;inesectOR webserver&rsquo; to predict, validate and analyse OR genes from the newly sequenced genomes [4]. Finally, we have also tried to predict the odorant-OR interaction site for the well known <em>A. mellifera</em> Or11 and QMP major component 9-ODA, using molecular modelling, docking and molecular dynamics simulations.</p>

InsectOR webserver [manuscript under preparation]</p> <br> Investigating the Proteasomal Transporter protein NUB1L </br><br><p>Protein turnover is essential to maintain cellular homeostasis. The tightly regulated proteins and misfolded proteins are tagged by attachment of Ubiquitin or Ubiquitin-like modifiers like FAT10. The tagged substrates are consequently directed by transporters to the 26S proteasome. NEDD8 Ultimate Buster-1L (NUB1L) is a unique protein that has been implicated to transport of both Ubiquitin and FAT10 modified proteasomal substrates. It has one UBL domain at the N terminus and three ubiquitin associated (UBA) domains at the C terminus. NUB1L binds to Ub/FAT10 by its UBA domains and to the proteasome via its UBL domain. We plan to investigate the molecular mechanism of how NUB1L recognizes substrates and transports it to the proteasome. In my AWS, I will discuss how the NUB1L UBA Domain 2 identifies ubiquitinated substrates. Moreover, I will also discuss about the differences between the stability of ubiquitin vs the NUB1L UBL domain, and, the interactions of NUB1L with the proteasomal receptors.</p> <br> Effect of experimental warming and elevational gradient on VOC-mediated plantâ€“insect interactions in high altitude alpine meadow ecosystems of the Himalayas    </br><br><p>Global average temperature has been increasing at an unprecedented rate since the early 20th century, and predicted to increase further by 2-3&deg;C in the next century. The effect of this climate warming on plant-insect interactions could be profound.&nbsp; While numerous studies have reported changes in phenological patterns and range shifts that break the synchrony between plants and their insect partners, relatively little is known about effects on chemical compounds that mediate interactions between plants and their associated insects. Warming could affect biosynthesis and volatility of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), which are crucial in interactions with insect associates, ultimately affecting community and ecosystem processes. Tropical montane ecosystems, such as the Himalayas, are especially vulnerable as the increase in average temperature is higher than the global average. Presently, little is known about warming effects on plant&ndash;insect interactions, in tropical alpine ecosystems.</p>
<p>We investigated the effect of warming on the floral VOCs of four plant species by conducting in situ warming experiments as well as comparison across an elevation gradient as temperature decreases with increasing elevation. We used warming chambers called Open Top Chambers which increase the ambient temperature by 2-3&deg;C, similar to predicted temperature increase in the next century. VOCs were collected using PDMS silicon tubing method, and analysed in a TD-GCMS. We observed significant intraspecies variation in floral VOC profiles at different temperatures and elevations.</p>
<p>This study will contribute to understanding climate warming effects on plant-insect interactions in tropical alpine meadows.</p>
<p></p> <br> Effects of the absence of FMRP on presynaptic protein levels </br><br><p>Fragile X Syndrome is an X-linked disorder that is the leading monogenetic cause for autism. It occurs due to the expansion of CGG repeats causing a hypermethylation and shut down of the <em>Fmr1</em> gene. and the loss of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). Three brain regions that have been studied in the context of this disorder are the cortex, hippocampus and amygdala. In these regions, FMRP is known to play a role in mediating plasticity, development of spines and many other functions. It has primarily been studied in the context of its post synaptic role as a translational repressor. Emerging evidence from all three regions mentioned above suggest a presynaptic role for FMRP as well, but the exact mechanism of how FMRP could contribute to these presynaptic effects is not very well studied. I present what I have found on the effects of the absence of FMRP on certain key presynaptic protein levels in the cortex and hippocampus.&nbsp;</p> <br> Plant  DJ-1 proteins confer dual stress tolerance through detoxification of methylglyoxal </br><br><p>DJ-1 is a member of ThiJ/DJ-1/PfpI protein superfamily. DJ-1 proteins are also called as moonlight proteins, they are multitasking, have been reported to be involved in several functions including oxidative stress sensing, protein folding, proteasome degradation, mitochondrial complex stabilization, methylglyoxalase and deglycation activities. PARK7 is the most extensively studied human DJ-1 homolog. Mutations in DJ-1 cause early-onset of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. DJ-1 protein is found in inclusion bodies together with Tau in patients of different tauopathies including Alzheimer disease. These results suggest that DJ-1 is involved in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, it has been shown that Hsp31, a yeast DJ-1 homolog, possesses robust glutathione independent glyoxalase activity that converts the toxic metabolite, methylglyoxal (MG), into D-lactate. We have recently shown that overexpression of yeast Hsp31, a DJ-1 homolog with robust MG detoxifying capabilities, confers dual biotic and abiotic stress tolerance in model plant Nicotiana tabacum. Strikingly, overexpression of Hsp31 in tobacco imparts robust stress tolerance against diverse biotic stress inducers such as viruses, <g class="gr_ gr_28 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="28" data-gr-id="28">bacteria</g> and fungi, in addition to tolerance against a range of abiotic stress inducers. During stress, Hsp31 was targeted to mitochondria and induced expression of key stress-related genes.</p>
<p>In order to gain insights into the functional relevance of DJ-1 proteins in plants, we have characterized functions of DJ-1 homologs from Arabidopsis thaliana. Unlike yeast and human DJ1 members, plant DJ-1 superfamily proteins are pseudo-dimeric proteins composed of a single polypeptide chain. A. <g class="gr_ gr_20 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling" id="20" data-gr-id="20">thaliana</g> contains six (DJ1A, DJ1B, DJ1C, DJ1D, <g class="gr_ gr_23 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="23" data-gr-id="23">DJ1E</g> and DJ1F) close homologs of animal DJ-1, functions of which are poorly understood. We find that Arabidopsis DJ-1 homologs namely, DJ1C and DJ1D, offer enhanced H2O2 tolerance in yeast HSP31 mutants, significantly to a higher level than ScHSP31 or human DJ-1 complementation. Transgenic plants expressing AtDJ-1D provided enhanced stress tolerance similar to HSP31. These findings are likely to shed light on the functions of plant DJ1 family proteins and more importantly, offer novel tools to engineer plants against multiple stresses.</p>

However, there is a multitude of genes responsible for ASDs. The complexity arises when attempting to understand how such a huge list of genes leads to only two major behavioral symptoms. Understanding the cellular mechanisms being altered by the genes would help in identifying points of convergence of all the mutated genes leading to common behavioral deficits. The convergent mechanisms can then be used as targets for reversing abnormalities.</p>
<p>In this study, I have focused on characterizing a transgenic rat model for ASD that has undergone a heterozygous mutation at a gene for a synaptic protein (<em>CNTNAP2),&nbsp;</em>which is the genotype prevalent in ASD population. Genes are the foundation of the behavior of an organism, so it is of interest to see whether the gene mutation is causing a change in activity at the single neuron level and/or at the neuronal network level, which, in turn, would influence behaviour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will present preliminary electrophysiological data in this transgenic rat model and lay down the immediate future plans to characterize the neuronal signatures of this model</p> <br>  Odor source localization in complex visual environments by fruit flies </br><br><p>Flying insects routinely forage in complex and cluttered sensory<br />environments. Their search for a food or a pheromone source typically<br />begins with a whiff of odor, which triggers a flight response, eventually<br />bringing the insect near the odor source. However, pinpointing the precise<br />location of an odor source requires use of both visual and olfactory<br />modalities, aided by odor plumes. Here, we investigated odor-tracking<br />behavior in fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) presented with low- or<br />high-contrast visual landmarks, either paired with or separate from an<br />attractive odor cue. These experiments were conducted either in a gentle<br />air stream which generated laminar odor plumes, or in still air in which<br />odor dissipates uniformly in all directions. Trajectories of flies<br />revealed several novel features of their odor-tracking behavior in<br />addition to those previously documented. First, in both moving and still<br />air, odor-seeking flies rely on co-occurrence of visual landmarks with<br />olfactory cues to guide them to odorant objects. Second, flies abruptly<br />decelerate upon encountering an odor plume, thereafter steering towards<br />nearest visual objects that had no inherent salience in the absence of<br />odor. Thus, interception of an attractive odor increases their salience to<br />nearby high-contrast visual landmarks. Third, flies adopt distinct odor<br />tracking strategies during flight in moving vs. still air. Whereas they<br />weave in and out of plumes towards an odor source in airflow, their<br />approach is more incremental in still air. Both strategies are robust and<br />flexible, and enable flies to reliably find the odor source under diverse<br />visual and airflow environments.</p> <br> Airflow information encoding by mechanosensory cephalic bristles of Oleander Hawkmoth, Daphnis nerii </br><br><p>Nocturnal insects like moths rely on various mechanosensors as the visual cues are limited at night. These mechanosensors aid in various aspects of flight. For example, the antenna is a well-studied mechanosensor that senses airflow direction and speed, and hence, necessary for flight. But, antennae are seen to be tucked back in a resting state and are not at immediate disposal if a moth has to take off within few milliseconds. Therefore, understandably, a moth is susceptible to predation if an immediate flight is not initiated when approached by a predator. However, moths escape when an air-puff is incident on the head, which could be a proxy for an approaching predator. So, we asked which mechanosensor could be mediating this behaviour. A set of head scales ablation experiments led us to hypothesise the presence of cephalic hair amidst the scales, which could be the putative mechanosensors that sense airflow. In an effort understand how these sensors mediate coordination of various parts of the body to initiate flight, I am beginning by looking at information encoding in these cephalic hair neurons with the aid of suction electrode recordings.</p> <br> Ecological and Evolutionary Dynamics of Mimicry Rings </br><br><p>Aposematism is the phenomenon of advertising toxicity through conspicuous warning signals to deter predators. Aposematic butterflies display their toxicity through striking wing colour patterns. This is the basis for two kinds of mimicry in butterflies&mdash;Mullerian mimicry, where toxic butterflies develop similar aposematic patterns thus sharing the cost of educating their predators about their unpalatability, and Batesian mimicry, wherein a non-toxic butterfly mimics the wing patterns of a toxic butterfly to gain protection from predators. A butterfly mimicry ring is a co-existing community of mimetic butterflies, both Mullerian and Batesian, which share similar wing colour pattern.The species composition, richness and diversity vary across rings and are a result of many evolutionary and ecological processes. This project is an attempt to identify and understand these processes that shape mimicry rings, with the butterfly mimicry rings of North East India as a study system.</p> <br> Sequence and Structural Studies of Protein Domain Superfamilies: Update of PASS2 Database (PASS2.6) </br><br><p>With the rapid growth in the development of structure determination methods, the number of protein structures deposited in PDB has been growing proportionally. This enables us to understand more about the protein structure-function relationships. However, it is important to classify the structures according to their evolutionary origin. Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) database aims at providing a detailed and comprehensive description of the structural and evolutionary relationships between the proteins whose structures are known. <g class="gr_ gr_37 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="37" data-gr-id="37">SCOPe</g> extends SCOP through a combination of automation and manual curation.</p>
<p>Sequence alignments of proteins provide a reliable basis for understanding structural, evolutionary and functional relationships between proteins. Proteins descending from the same common ancestor and falling within the same superfamily can, however, be sequentially divergent rendering routine sequence alignment methods inappropriate. In such cases, structure-based sequence alignments of superfamily members can be used for genome-wide sequence searches as well as genome-wide association studies leading to SNP identification and drug discovery.</p>
<p>Protein Alignments organized as Structural Superfamilies or PASS2 is a database which provides such alignments for protein domain superfamilies and has been updated continuously since 2002. Protein structural domains which have less than 40% sequence identity amongst themselves are chosen from SCOPe for alignment and are systematically included in the PASS2 database. In the present update, we have assembled structure-based sequence alignments of 2006 superfamilies with close to 14000 structures of protein domains. Features such as solvent accessibility, Hidden Markov Model or HMM profiles, absolutely conserved residues, etc. have also been provided alongside the alignments. While aiming at automation, we have modified the pipeline depending on circumstances. I will discuss how outliers and extreme outliers were handled for superfamilies where automatic alignment was rendered difficult. I will also discuss few case studies for further exemplification. The current update is PASS2.6 and is in accordance with SCOPe 2.06.</p>

In fast-growing organisms such as <em>Escherichia coli (E.coli)</em>, multiple replication initiations result in a higher gene dosage near to the origin compared to the terminus. Even though the replication centered organization of chromosome is well established in bacteria, It is known that E.coli can survive and divide <g class="gr_ gr_14 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="14" data-gr-id="14">independent</g> of <em>oriC</em> by initiating replication from alternative sites on the chromosome.

An<em> E. col</em>i strain engineered to initiate replication from R-loops (Prof. Gowrishankar lab, CDFD), displays a slow growth phenotype. Laboratory evolution of this strain revealed the rapid generation of suppressors, which showed better growth rates. Preliminary sequencing of these suppressors using short-read technologies indicated the presence of a large chromosomal inversion (~20% of the chromosome) marked by repeat sequences. Future work will study the statistics of the nature of mutations that suppress the growth defect of the parent strain, as well as understand the mechanisms by which they do so.</p>
<p></p> <br> Metabolic variation in Methylobacterium species associated with rice landraces from North-East India </br><br><p>The importance of <em>Methylobacterium</em> as a bacterial symbiont of plants is well-studied: the bacteria utilize methanol released during plant cell wall degradation, and in turn secrete plant growth factors (Dourado et al, 2015). Although such associations might lead to distinct patterns of distribution and divergence of interacting partners, the biogeography of plant-<em>Methylobacterium</em> communities is not clearly understood. We focus on multiple rice landraces grown in geographically isolated locations in North-East (NE) India, that harbour substantial phenotypic and genotypic diversity (Roy et al., 2015). This diversity in rice plants might impose divergent selection on the bacterial partners associated with each landrace. We obtained ~400 <em>Methylobacterium</em> isolates from ~50 rice landraces, and found that the diversity and distribution of <em>Methylobacterium</em> species varied not only across different landraces but also across different parts of the rice plant. We observed substantial diversity in the carbon utilization profiles of these <em>Methylobacterium</em> isolates, across 12 different carbon resources. Strains of the same bacterial species from different regions showed variable carbon use capability, and are thus likely to harbour substantial genomic variation. Interestingly, all the <em>Methylobacterium</em> isolates showed a strong negative correlation between growth on methanol and methylamine. This potential tradeoff is surprising because the genus <em>Methylobacterium</em> is characterized by the ability to use both these single carbon sources, and previous work demonstrates substantial overlap in the respective metabolic pathways (Gomez et al., 2013). Overall, our results indicate significant biogeographic variability in <em>Methylobacterium</em> at the community, species and metabolic levels. In further work, we intend to test whether specific interactions between the rice host and bacteria may explain the observed phenotypic variation across bacterial isolates.</p> <br> Role of Kallikrein related Peptidases-10 in wound healing and fibrosis </br><br><p>The skin plays important roles in protecting the body from pathogens and prevention of water loss. When a wound occurs, homeostasis is restored via three distinct but overlapping phases: inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. These phases are coordinated by extensive intercellular communication via secreted signaling molecules. The deregulation of this crosstalk can lead to various pathological conditions such as fibrosis, which is marked by excessive extracellular matrix deposition by chronically activated fibroblasts resulting in tissue dysfunction. Using a mouse model of cutaneous fibrosis wherein the transcription factor Snail is overexpressed in epidermal keratinocytes has led to the identification of secreted factors that may activate dermal fibroblasts. One of these is Kallikrein-related Peptidase-10 (KLK-10). KLK-10 is a member of a serine proteases family whose canonical function is as an antimicrobial peptide activator, but the presence of KLK-10 in the secretome suggests its potential role in fibrosis. Thus, we are investigating the mechanisms regulating KLK-10 expression and its possible role in fibroblast activation during wound healing and fibrosis. It has been shown that a subset of T-cells known gdT cells enhances expression of antimicrobial peptides, we hypothesized that <g class="gr_ gr_14 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="14" data-gr-id="14">gdT</g> cells may likewise modulate KLK-10 in vivo. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that KLK10 expression is delayed in wounded gdT cell knockout mice. Our model proposes that KLK10 expression is regulated by a gdT cells-keratinocytes interaction mediated by additional factors. We also found KLK10 transcript levels increase in the post inflammatory phase of wound healing, where fibroblasts are activated, which supports the idea of a novel role of KLK-10 outside of inflammation but in the proliferative phase of wound healing in which fibroblasts are activated.</p> <br> self-assembly of passive monomers in bath of active particles </br><br><p>Active particles are systems out of equilibrium exhibiting emergent phenomenon such as motility induced phase separation and trapping at corners of appropriate shape. In our study, we propose a mechanism for the control of passive particles suspended in an active bath by designing an appropriate interplay between the particle shape and the properties of the active bath. We design passive particles such that active particles of different kinds can be trapped on either side of the particle. We use this to then drive the particles to interfaces of co-existing MIPS-like active clusters, where they can either be used as probes or as assembly units. We use molecular dynamics simulations and experiments comprised of isotropic 3D printed particles, activated on a electromagnetic shaker, using which we explore these ideas.</p> <br> Not Available </br><br><p>Not available.</p>

Such response mechanisms are primarily through signalling pathways that ultimately orchestrate changes in gene expression. Regulation of gene expression in a context-dependent manner plays a crucial role in cell fate specification and functional status.</p>
<p>In neurons, differential gene expression is responsible for axonal and dendritic growth, the efficacy of synaptic transmission, and synaptic plasticity- all of which affects the organization and function of the brain and ultimately dictates behaviour. As in other non-excitable cells, Ca2+ in neurons acts as a critical secondary messenger downstream of several signalling pathways. Regulation of calcium homeostasis has been shown to play a crucial role in regulating neuronal gene expression which subsequently modulates neuronal function.</p>
<p>Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) refers to a unique Ca2+ entry route that is specifically activated by depletion of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) following receptor-mediated ER Ca2+ release. The sustained rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels that is facilitated by SOCE does more, than merely refilling stores â€“ it shapes the spatiotemporal nature of Ca2+ signals and regulates a broad range of cellular responses.</p>
<p>Over the time course of organismal development, specifically during the pupal stage in fruitflies, SOCE plays a crucial role in the maturation of neurons. This may be through Ca2+ based signalling pathways that influence the expression of neurotransmitters and thereby determine neuronal function. Perturbations in SOCE, primarily in specific neuronal subsets such as in dopaminergic neurons have been shown to lead to impairments in circuit development that ultimately manifest as flight behaviour deficits in adults. Although we know that SOCE regulates transcription of genes essential for neuronal function, the mechanism of such regulation is unclear. Signals such as SOCE related cytosolic calcium transients must get relayed to the nucleus wherein they must interact with and instruct the transcriptional machinery to modulate gene expression events. In the context of fly neurons, there do not appear to exist any readily apparent molecule/s that can perform this feat. I shall discuss ways to tackle this question using a combination of differential gene expression profiling, bioinformatic tools, and biochemical methods.</p> <br> Negative regulation of G2-M in the presence of Cdc25/String facilitates tracheoblast  growth and tracheal hypertrophy in Drosophila </br><br><p>Imaginal progenitors in Drosophila arrest in G2 during larval stages and proliferate thereafter. Here we investigate the mechanism for and implications of G2 arrest in progenitors of the adult thoracic tracheal epithelium (tracheoblasts).Â  We report that tracheoblasts are paused in G2 for ~48-56 hr and grow in size in this period. Surprisingly, tracheoblasts in G2 express positive regulators of G2-M like Cdc25/String (Stg). We also find that in these cells Checkpoint Kinase 1/Grapes (Chk1) is activated in an ATR/Mei41-dependent manner, and mitochondria are fused, not fragmented. G2 arrest was abrogated by simultaneous loss of ATR-Chk1 and activation of mitochondrial fission via PINK1 overexpression. This induction of precocious mitoses impaired growth of tracheoblasts and the tracheae they comprise. Our findings reveal a role for ATR-Chk1 axis in G2 arrest in tracheoblasts and show that G2 arrest in these cells facilitates cellular and organ growth.</p> <br> TITLE IS NOT AVAILABLE </br><br><p>The identification and discrimination of objects is the fundamental task for all animal brains. Like all life forms, hoverflies need to find objects in a cluttered world, in this case, flowers. Hoverflies are important generalist pollinators of crops and wild plants. They are cosmopolitan and solitary insects. To find flowers, hoverflies utilize visual and olfactory cues in a context-dependent manner.</p>
<p>We have identified an artificial model â€“ set of floral cues â€“ which are attractive to hoverflies continents. We thus suspect, this model to contain floral cues which are innately attractive to hoverflies, regardless of environmental context.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the minimum cues evoking flower visitation in hoverflies is unknown. My project aims to parse the model further and find the minimum set of cues sufficient to elicit flower visitation in hoverflies. To answer this question, I am carrying out behavioural experiments in semi-natural settings with hoverflies that are naÃ¯ve to flowers. By checking for their preferences for different cues in the model, we can identify the minimum set of cues evoking flower visitation in hoverflies.</p>
<p>Identifying the minimal set of cues evoking floral visitation in hoverflies can eventually help us understand how these cues are integrated in the central nervous system to give rise to the recognition of a flower, and thus how small brains can identify complex objects</p>
<p>Â </p> <br> Insight into the mechanism of transcriptional gene silencing in plants using geminiviral proteins </br><br><p style="text-align:justify;">Gene silencing involves suppression of gene expression by repressing its transcription. If this suppression results in the level of transcription, then it is referred as transcriptional gene silencing (TGS). TGS operates in the nucleus and regulates expression of transposons, repeats, certain genes and retro-elements through DNA methylation and histone modifications. Initiation and maintenance of TGS is mediated by a plant-specific RNA based mechanism termed RNA-dependent DNA Methylation (RdDM). This RNA based mechanism requires a specific sized small RNAs of 24 nucleotides. RdDM in plants is unique as it is dependent on specialized transcription machinery involving Polymerase-II related enzymes called Pol-IV and Pol-V. Pol-IV produces non-coding transcripts from heterochromatinized regions in the nucleus that get converted to double-stranded intermediates by plant-specific RNA dependent RNA polymerase 2. Dicer-like 3 (DCL3) endonucleases process long dsRNA into 24-nt small interfering (si)RNAs which is subsequently loaded to Argonaute (AGO).This ribonucleoprotein complex subsequently targets the viral genome by recruiting DNA methyltransferases like DRMâ€™s for de novo methylation and subsequent silencing of the target loci through histone modifications. In order to counter this host defense mechanism, successful viruses have developed specialized multifunctional proteins called Viral Suppressors of RNA Silencing (VSR). VSRs interfere and modify the RdDM machinery at multiple levels protecting the viral genome from host induced methylation facilitating their replication inside the host. We hypothesize that VSRs can be excellent tools to understand the biogenesis and mechanism of action of 24-ntsiRNAs and RNA mediated transcriptional silencing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Geminiviruses and their satellites have circular single-stranded DNA genomes. To successfully invade new hosts, break host resistance, move virus particles within and between plants, geminiviruses, and their satellites have evolved a coordinated network of protein interactions. Many proteins from geminivirus have been shown to possess VSR activity. Recently a 1.3kb Beta satellite coded protein BetaC1 was shown to act as a major pathogenicity determinant in systemic infection and invasion of host cells. It was shown previously that the presence of Î²C1 highly increases viral replication and movement of the viral DNA, this can be attributed to Î²C1â€™s ability to act as a VSR (Viral Suppressor of RNA Silencing). The exact mechanism is not known but it may be a property of its affinity towards all forms of nucleic acids (ssDNA, dsDNA, ssRNA, dsRNA). Our recent work shows that Î²C1 from SYVV (SYNEDRELLA YELLOW VEIN VIRUS) a new virus characterized in our lab, binds only to ssDNA and to ssRNA to some extent but with far less affinity and do not bind to dsDNA or dsRNA as previously reported for other Î²C1. In our binding experiments, we have observed a Mg2+ dependent endonucleases and exonuclease activity of Î²C1 on single-stranded and circular single-stranded DNA substrates. This study opens a new arena to understand a previously unreported VSR activity of Î²C1 and provides us a chance to understand how this surprising activity of Î²C1 is countering host TGS and helping the virus to propagate.</p> <br> Studying the Native State Dynamics of Double Chain Monellin (Natural Variant of  Single chain monellin) </br><br><p>Protein structures are very dynamic and show different types of opening motions even in the native conditions and might result in the complete unfolding. Such opening transitions in the native conditions can be monitored by the native state hydrogen exchange (HX) in conjunction with mass spectrometry (MS). The advantage of using HX coupled with MS is that it gives the population level information and can delineate non-cooperative vs. cooperative opening motions. Double chain monellin (dcMN) is naturally occurring dimeric protein with intensely sweet taste. Single chain monellin (scMN) is the engineered version of dcMN made by covalently linking the two chains of dcMN. Previous studies from the lab on scMN showed that the cooperativity of the (un)folding transitions can be tuned by changing the thermodynamic stability of the protein. Although the structure and sequence of dcMN are identical to scMN, dcMN is thermodynamically more stable (~ 5.5 kcal/mol) than scMN. Since previous studies have suggested the dynamic coupling between stability and protein folding cooperativity, it is interesting to study and compare how stabilization affects the native state dynamics of dimeric protein dcMN. Native state dynamics study suggests that both the chains behave differently in terms of their intrinsic dynamics. Chain AÂ  shows cooperative opening while chain B shows complete non-cooperative openings. In future, peptide level information will be obtained in order to understand region specific dynamics.</p> <br> Characterization of nurses in Apis florea </br><br><p>Division of labour is a key feature in the successful survival of eusocial insects like honey bees. In general, young worker honey bees perform inhive activities and the older workers go out as foragers. These behavioural changes are accompanied by corresponding changes in the brain gene expression. However, most of the work in honey bees so far been done on Apis mellifera. However there are 8 other honey bee species that have been characterized so far. Except Apis mellifera all other honey bees species belong to only south east Asia. &nbsp;As there is not much work been done on Asian honey bees, I chose to study Apis florea because Apis florea is ancestral in the genus Apis and they live 2.5 times longer compared to Apis mellifera. In-spite of its importance, study on Apis florea is difficult. This is mainly because Apis florea is open nesting and description of in-hive behaviour is difficult due to the presence of bee-curtain. Here, I present the first experimental method to characterize the in-hive behaviour of A. florea. The experiment involves the attachment of a secondary comb that has open larvae to the main colony comb. I show results from this method, describing the activity of workers feeding the larvae in the secondary comb. I also present results from the comparison of the hypopharyngeal gland of A.florea foragers and workers feeding larvae. My results suggest that these workers are indeed nurses and provide an opportunity to observe other in-hive activities in A.florea.</p> <br> Association of prostate cancer susceptibility with non-coding genetic variation in the 8q24 locus </br><br><p>Recent Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated non-coding genetic variations in enhancers with various diseases and cancers suggesting that genetic variations alter enhancer functions and thereby the expression of the cognate coding genes. However, the mechanism behind this variation-mediated disruption of enhancer function is not well understood. In this study, we try to dissect the functional mechanisms by which the allele rs72725854, predisposes African population to prostate cancer risk. The rare allele rs72725854 falls in the 8q24.2 locus that harbours several prostate specific lncRNAs as PCAT1, PCAT2, PRNCR1 as well as the coding gene c-Myc. ChIP-seq, DHS-seq and Gro-seq analyses identify a strong transcriptional enhancer harbouring rs72725854 in prostate-specific LNCaP cells functionally correlating this enhancer with neighbouring lncRNA expression. Further, chromatin capture around this enhancer detected physical interaction between rs72725854 harbouring enhancer and lncRNAs PCAT1, PCAT2 and PRNCR1 genes suggesting, a direct transcriptional regulation. Motif comparison Tool, Tomtom predicts a gain of SPDEF transcription factor binding motif in the risk allele (A/G&gt;T) which in turn is strongly implicated in prostrate cancer. ChIP-qpcr on plasmids also show enrichment of SPDEF in the T allele, thus strengthening the prediction. Reporter assays show that the enhancer is stronger when the risk allele T is present as opposed A or G and is also DHT responsive. Generation of LNCaP cells with different alleles of the SNP would help to study the regulation of the target genes by this enhancer. This study would enable us to identify the functional roles of SNPs in enhancers thereby, would uncover the enhancer mechanisms as well as in the long term, develop therapeutic approaches to complex diseases that are driven by such enhanceropathies.Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â </p> <br> Towards the structure and function of glycosomal sugar nucleotide transporters in Trypanosomatida </br><br><p>Trypanosomatida comprise diverse order of pathogenic protozoans. They include human pathogens like Trypanosoma brucei Leishmania donovani and Trypanosoma cruzi. An interesting feature of these parasites lies in the existence of morphologically distinct classes. One distinguishing characteristic in such forms is the presence of unique and abundant surface glycoproteins which are essential for the virulence and survival of the parasite.</p>
<p>The key towards making such glycoproteins are the availability of nucleotide sugars. In trypanosomes bulk of the nucleotide sugar biosynthesis occur in glycosomes which are organelles homologus to peroxisomes. Therefore it is evident that nucleotide sugars need to be transported out to the cytoplasm and then to the ER Golgi to facilitate glycosylations and other such processes. The nucleotide sugar transporters NSTs described so far is known to localize to ER Golgi. Recent unpublished work by Lucia <em>et. al.</em> have observed that a novel glycosomal NST gNST1 exports UDP sugars from the lumen of glycosomes out to the cytoplasm. Microinjection of Xenopus oocytes with gNST1 mRNA followed by radioactive sugar uptake showed specificity to UDP Glc UDP Gal and UDP GlcNac. Further the fact that gNST1 do not have any apparent homologues to mammals or insects is should be noted.</p>
<p><br />We are interested in unravelling the mechanism by which gNST1 transports UDP sugars by solving its structure. Towards this we have gene synthesized gNST1 and its homologues from other trypanosomatids or plants. This consists of 4 different genera within Trypanosomatids and plants. I would talk on the progress made towards cloning screening expression and purification of gNST1 and its homologues in yeast.</p> <br> Role of Cephalic mechanosensors in flight initiation of hawkmoths </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">For insects, mechanosensory feedback about airflow relative to the body is crucial for maintaining stable flight. Such feedback also plays a crucial role in flight stabilization and maintenance of air speed, even during rapid maneuvers or long, steady flight bouts. We are investigating the neural mechanisms of air flow detection in the Oleander hawk moths <em>Daphnis nerii</em>, with specific reference to their role in flight initiation. Our behavioral experiments showed robust flight initiation response to frontal air puff stimuli to cephlaic mechanosensory bristles. When stimulated by an air puff in tethered hawkmoths, these sensors cause rapid, sequential and systemic initiation of multiple reflexes including antennal positioning reflex, head stabilization, wing initiation, leg extension and abdominal flexion. This flight initiation bypasses warm-up phase which is typically observed during voluntary flight in nocturnal hawkmoths.To study how cephalic mechanosensory bristles elicit activation of flight motor system, we dye filled mechanosensory neurons the axons of which span the distance from brain to the mesothoracic ganglia where flight motor neurons are located. Preliminary results from extracellular recordings also show that antennal muscles are activated upon stimulation of these mechanosensory bristles. Based on these data, we propose that these reflexes are sequentially activated due to the stimulation of the cephalic bristles.</p> <br> Mass spectrometric quantification of amine titers in single honey bee brains and brain parts </br><br><p>Honeybees are excellent model systems to study natural behavior under experimentally manipulable conditions. However, being genetically not amenable, there are not too many ways to study its neural basis.There is a large volume of data on modulation of behavior by substances called biogenic amines.</p>
<p>Over the last few years I have improved a mass spectrometric method to measure these and their precursors in single honey bee brains and brain parts. Using this we are now able to expand the range of behaviors and even the organisms we study them in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this AWS I will show the results of experiments studying motivation in bees in the context of anticipation and search.&nbsp;</p> <br> A Suv39H1-low chromatin state drives migratory cell populations in cervical cancer </br><br><p>The emergence of migratory cell subpopulations represents a critical stage during cancer metastasis. We have previously reported enhanced migratory phenotypes in one such population, marked by CD66, in cervical cancers. It is unclear what mechanisms drive such migratory populations, and how they would retain a â€œmemoryâ€ of initial migration-inducing cues during metastasis. Here, we examine heterochromatin regulator Suv39H1, which catalyses the H3K9me3 histone mark, and observe that a Suv39H1-low state drives cervical cancer migratory populations. Cervical cancer cells sorted based on migratory ability in vitro showed low Suv39H1, and Suv39H1 depletion enhanced migration. Histopathology of clinical progression showed a proliferative expansion of a Suv39H1-high population in early stages of progression, and the emergence of a migratory Suv39H1-low population in advanced stages. Meta-analysis of cervical cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed that low tumoural Suv39H1 also correlated with lower patient survival, and with migration and CD66 linked gene expression signatures. Lastly, RNA-Seq and H3K9me3 ChIP-Seq highlighted Suv39H1-linked transcriptome alterations and broad scale H3K9me3 remodelling in migrated populations. Such Suv39H1-based regulation would allow plasticity and memory in migratory populations, through metastable changes in heterochromatin conformation. The understanding of such regulators of migratory populations may prove valuable in efforts to develop anti-metastatic strategies.</p> <br> INVALID ENTRY </br><br><p>INVALID ENTRY.</p> <br> Molecular basis of vasculature defects in a mouse model of the fibrotic skin disease scleroderma </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Fibrosis is a pathological condition wherein excessive deposition of extracellular matrix components leads to tissue hardening and loss of function. The absence of effective therapies for fibrosis illustrates the need for exploring conserved mechanisms in this pathology. Clinical investigators hold the view that microvasculature abnormalities are a foundational cause of fibrotic disorders like scleroderma, however the mechanisms underlying these vasculopathies are largely unknown. Given that the transcription factor Snail is upregulated in a number of fibrotic conditions including scleroderma, we used a transgenic mouse model for skin fibrosis, expressing Snail in the basal epidermal keratinocytes. We found that this ectopic expression of Snail was sufficient to induce vascular changes such as deformed vessels, increased endothelial cells proliferation, vascular leakage and gene expression changes reminiscent of scleroderma vasculopathy. Using this transgenic mouse model, we are poised to investigate the molecular mechanisms of scleroderma-like microvascular abnormalities. We hypothesized that Angiopoietin-like protein 2 (Angptl2), one of the factors secreted by the Snail transgenic keratinocytes is a major contributor towards these microvasculature deformations. Preliminary results suggest that Angptl2 is indeed secreted from scleroderma skin epidermis in vivo. In ex-vivo mouse explant studies, Angptl2 can recapitulate some of the vasculature changes observed in vivo such as vessel morphology changes and transcriptional upregulation of certain vasculature-modulating factors. This work thus lays the basis for further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms behind the observed vasculature damage and its implication in fibrosis. These studies have the potential of identifying novel therapeutic targets which can aid in correcting the vascular defect and abrogating the fibrotic phenotype.</p> <br> Effect of restricting head stabilization on flight stability in hawkmoths </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Flying insects require exceptional control and orientation stability during aerial manoeuvres involved with chasing prey, foraging search flight, courtship behaviour, feeding while hovering and escaping predation etc. in their ecological niche. Since the eyes of the insects are fixed relative to the head, they need compensatory head movements to fixate the gaze on their retinal coordinate system. The head is in an ambiguous situation as it is coupled to visual cues on one end while experiencing the active and passive vibrations on the other. Thus, head stabilization plays a key role in reducing this conflict. In hawkmoths, it has been shown that amputated flagellum of the antennae reduces flight stability. It is hypothesized that the antennal mechanosensors are the putative body-balance sensing organ in four-winged insects lacking halteres that typically fly in extremely low-light conditions. Now, these probable balance sensors are present on the head. From a recent ongoing work, we observed that removing antennal flagellum and restricting the antennal mechanosensors (Johnston&rsquo;s organ) diminishes head stabilization. Hence, we wanted to check the stability effects in free flight after restricting head stabilization. This was done by restraining the movements of the hawkmoth&rsquo;s head relative to its thorax. We see a clear difference in the free flight behaviour of the head movement restricted animals compared to their control and sham counterparts. Next, we are trying to investigate neck proprioception mechanism(s) which encode the head posture relative to thorax and send this information to neck muscles for actuating the head position back to its set-point decided by antennal mechanosensory inputs, vision and other cues.</p> <br> Of bark damage and recovery, elephants, fire and ants in an African savanna </br><br><p>The trunks or stems of savanna trees are typically exposed to high levels of damage from both large herbivores and fire, yet we know surprisingly little about how trees respond to such damage. This study investigates 1) how savanna woody plants respond to bark damage and 2) how fire affects bark recovery. To answer 1) sections of bark were removed from five trees each for the dominant woody species at five study sites in southern KNP. Recovery rates were then monitored at regular intervals.&nbsp; To answer 2), I removed bark from five Marula (Sclerocarya birrea) trees in each of four replicates of high intensity (Aug2), low intensity (Annual) and no burn treatments in the Pretoriuskop string of long-term burnplots. The plots were burnt in August 2016 after which recovery was monitored. The dominant species at the study sites were found to respond very differently to bark damage, while the effects of fires were found to have some unexpected consequences for bark recovery in Marula trees. Results from the two experiments will be presented and discussed.</p> <br> Role of SOCE (STIM1) in self-renewing human neural precursors  </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Ca2&nbsp;+ signaling plays a significant role in development of the vertebrate nervous system where it regulates neurite growth as well as synapse and neurotransmitter specification (Rosenberg and Spitzer, 2011). Elucidating the role of Ca2&nbsp;+&nbsp;signaling in mammalian neuronal development has been largely restricted to either small animal models or primary cultures. We derived human neural precursor cells (NPCs) from human embryonic stem cells to understand the functional significance of a less understood arm of calcium signaling, Store-operated Ca2+ entry or SOCE, in neuronal development. Human NPCs exhibited robust SOCE, which was significantly attenuated by expression of a stable shRNA-miR targeted towards the SOCE molecule STIM1. Along with the plasma membrane channel Orai, STIM is an essential component of SOCE in many cell types where it regulates gene expression. Therefore, we measured global gene expression in human NPCs with and without STIM1 knockdown. Interestingly, pathways down-regulated through STIM1 knockdown were related to cell proliferation and DNA replication processes whereas post-synaptic signaling was identified as an up-regulated process. To understand the functional significance of these gene expression changes we measured the self-renewal capacity of NPCs with STIM1 knockdown. The STIM1 knockdown NPCs demonstrated significantly reduced neurosphere size and number as compared to control cells. Moreover, precocious differentiation spontaneously towards the neuronal lineage was prominent. These findings demonstrate that STIM1 mediated SOCE in human NPCs regulates gene expression changes, that in vivo are likely to physiologically modulate the self-renewal and differentiation of NPCs.</p>

Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol 3:1&ndash;13.</p> <br> In vivo regulation of Phospholipase D activity. </br><br><p>Phosphatidic acid (PA) is a phospholipid which is involved in multiple structural and signalling functions. There are multiple ways by which PA can be generated in the cell. One of them is via an enzyme called Phospholipase D which gets activated in parallel to PLC signalling during GPCR activation. This enzyme has been implicated in various cellular processes like cytoskeletal remodelling, vesicular trafficking etc. Although a lot is known about the downstream functions of this enzyme, we do not have a clear idea about the in vivo regulation of its enzyme activity. Recent work from our lab using <em>Drosophila</em> photoreceptors has shown that there exists light induced Phospholipase D (dPLD) activity in fly photoreceptors which regulates PA levels. This in turn regulates plasma membrane turnover in a retromer dependent manner. However, the exact mechanism behind this stimulus dependent activity remains elusive.</p>
<p>I am currently trying to understand the in vivo regulation of stimulus dependent dPLD activity using <em>Drosophila</em> photoreceptors. There could be various ways by which this enzyme is regulated. One possible mechanism could be via Protein-Lipid or Protein-Protein interactions the signals for which could be present within the protein of interest itself. I am currently trying to test this and would be discussing the same.</p> <br> Structural insights into signal responsive bacterial transcription regulators </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Bacteria sense their environment through a signal relay system constituting a sensor which responds to a cue, and a response regulator which is activated by the sensor that regulates expression of target genes. Multiple targets linked to the signal are controlled by this process. Regulation of gene expression has also been shown at post-transcriptional levels which involves protein binding to nascent RNA dictating its fate. This regulation requires the involvement of a high-fidelity protein-RNA system. One of such systems known is a family of proteins containing an RNA-binding domain, AmiR and NasR Transcriptional Anti-termination Regulator (ANTAR). As the name suggests, ANTAR proteins abort pre-mature termination of mRNA by binding to 5&rsquo; UTR region thus destabilising the intrinsic terminator formed. Currently, there are four different ANTAR proteins that have been studied of which structures of three proteins have been determined to date &ndash;AmiR (O&rsquo;Hara et al. 1999)â  , NasR (Boudes et al. 2012)â  , and Rv1626(Morth et al. 2004)â  . Structures of the proteins are in either their inactive conformation or in the inhibitor bound complex.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While AmiR, NasR, and EutV (Ramesh et al. 2012)â  are reported to form oligomers, Rv1626 is reported only as a monomer. Based on the sequence, Rv1626 is 68% similar to EutV, we observe Rv1626 adopts a compact structure than EutV, and Rv1626 binds RNA even as a monomer. The stark differences observed despite their similarity hints these proteins might carryout different functions in their&nbsp; respective systems. To obtain functional protein, that does not require activation, we constructed phopho-mimic versions of EutV and Rv1626 and confirmed them by comparing their RNA-binding activity with wild-type (WT) protein. We are attempting to solve the molecular structure of the phopho-mimic proteins which will shed light on conformational changes that mediate protein-RNA interactions and highlight differences in the arrangement of Rv1626 and EutV, if any. In future, we aim to obtain the structure of EutV and Rv1626 in complex with RNA and use this information to identify potential targets of ANTAR proteins in other organisms.</p> <br> Ligand induced cooperativity by reduction in the native state heterogeneity in a protein with disrupted tertiary packing </br><br><p>Native state of a protein need not essentially have a unique three-dimensional structure, they can in fact very flexible and dynamic entities and can exist in more than one conformations, separated by small energy barriers. Modulating solvent conditions, mutation or presence of a binding partner can modulate the free energy landscape of a protein. The primary aim of this study is to investigate the link between conformational heterogeneity and folding properties of a protein, with disrupted tertiary packing and to see the modulation of its properties by one of its binding partners. In this AWS, I will be discussing this question that we have tried to answer with a small protein domain PI3K SH3 domain and its ligand as our model system. We have predominantly used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy coupled to photoinduced electron transfer as our probe to monitor protein folding, as well as conformational heterogeneity. We see that ligand binding to this non-cooperative-like folding protein, with disrupted tertiary packing makes the protein cooperative-like by reducing the heterogeneity in the native state.</p> <br> Understanding metabolic regulation of the methylglyoxal detoxification pathway. </br><br><p>Methylglyoxal (MG) is commonly considered as a byproduct of glycolysis. This dicarbonyl compound can form adducts with DNA, RNA and proteins and therefore, has potential to influence the cell by epigenetic or genetic alterations. Glyoxalase, an enzyme which detoxifies MG to lactate, has been of special interest to the cancer field and has been suspected sometimes as an oncogene and the other times as a tumor suppressor gene. However, a comprehensive analysis of the regulation of MG-glyoxalase pathway is missing in the field to reach any conclusion. With yeast as a model system, we have started looking at the metabolic regulation of the pathway. Contrary to intuition, we observe that cells grown in lactate (where gluconeogenesis and mitochondrial respiration are predominant pathways) defend themselves better to the MG stress than those grown in glucose. To explain this phenomenon, we are testing different hypotheses and I shall present preliminary results obtained so far. Based on our data, we are evaluating whether G3P-DHAP (Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate-DiHydroxyAcetone Phosphate) node, rather than mere flux through glycolysis, could be the central determinant of MG-glyoxalase balance in the cell.</p> <br> ROLE OF NUCLEAR MYOSIN IN GENOME ORGANIZATION  </br><br><p>Actin dependent molecular motors known as Myosin have been implicated in various important roles inside the cell, such as in transport functions as well as in providing structural support. Though, myosins has been extensively studied for its roles in various biological functions outside the nucleus but, its functions in the nucleus are largely ignored. Recently, myosins have been reported in the nucleus and it has been shown that particularly, Myosin IC (Myo1C) plays a direct role in transcription. However, being the motor proteins, they are most likely to play a key role in chromatin architecture which may rely on ATP-dependent directional movements of chromatin fibre. I propose to detect such involvement of Myosin IC in the chromatin regulation and further, extend the knowledge to identify other myosin proteins and their functions in the nucleus.</p> <br> Ubiquitin mediated regulation of glucose homeostasis in yeast </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">The ability to regulate multiple metabolic pathways depending on the availability of nutrients is critical to the development of all cells. The cell has to choose the right set of metabolic pathways that best suits its growth and development in the given set of conditions. There exist key regulators which act as metabolic switches to control the shift between these pathways. These switches themselves must be regulated depending on the nutrient accessibility, by metabolic sensors. However, our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying this is limited. Recent studies have witnessed the emergence of ubiquitination as an important post-translational modification in regulating different proteins involved in multiple metabolic pathways. We are currently trying to understand in detail, the mechanisms underlying the ubiquitin mediated regulation of a candidate metabolic switch during metabolic transitions from low to high glucose. We aim to unravel the role of ubiquitination machinery in general, and E3 ubiquitin ligases in particular, as metabolic sensors and regulators of metabolic switches, using <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> as the model system.</p> <br> Computational approach to study DNA repeats and constraints on their occurrence in prokaryotes </br><br><p>Prokaryotic genomes, though small and compact, are abundant in repetitive DNA elements. DNA repeats, ranging from short (&lt;10-mer) to long (up to thousands of mer) sequences, are thought to be evolutionary selected. These repeats have been shown to be involved in essential processes like DNA break repair, chromosomal rearrangements, and thus play a crucial role in regulating genome function and architecture.</p>
<p>We aim to study the function of these repeat elements and constraints on their occurrance across prokaryotes using computational approaches. First part of our work focuses to predict short DNA motifs called chi sequences, and study their coevolution with respective interacting proteins. These motifs are involved in double strand DNA break repair mediated by homologous recombination in prokaryotes. Interestingly, the validated chi sequences (across different bacteria) neither have significant similarity in sequence nor in length. Current work is to understand the distribution properties of chi sequences. The second part of our study aims to find out conservation in position of long sequence repeats (&gt;100-mer) which is known to be involved in chromosomal rearrangements in prokaryotes.</p>
<p>The study would provide an insight in understanding the role of these DNA elements in maintaining genome integrity.</p> <br> Myrmecochory: The role of the elaiosome </br><br><p><em>Ricinus communis</em> seeds carry fatty appendages known as elaiosome that mediate secondary seed dispersal by ants, known as myrmecochory. The role of various cues and actual impacts on the plant in this interaction remain largely uncharacterised. Myrmecochorous ants were determined to be attracted towards olfactory cues of castor seeds. <em>Pheidole sp.</em> was efficient in seed displacement and in the absence of caruncle, ants were found to completely ignore seeds. Fatty acid and sugar analyses showed differences between castor ecotypes. Plant germination was found to be improved significantly upon elaiosome removal. An extract of the elaiosome as applied to seed also inhibited germination in seeds from which elaiosomes were detached. Elaiosome could thus play a critical role in seed dispersal to promote germination under favourable conditions.</p> <br> Understanding structure and dynamics of the Drosophila PI(4,5)P2 cycle using mathematical models </br><br><p>In many eukaryotic signalling cascades, receptor mediated phospholipase C (PLC) activity triggers phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) hydrolysis leading to information transfer in cells. Coupled with PLC activation is a sequence of reactions spread across multiple compartments by which PIP<sub>2</sub> is resynthesized, a process essential to maintain PIP<sub>2</sub> levels and support sustained PLC signalling. The biochemical strategies to co-ordinate these reactions and support PIP<sub>2</sub> levels have remained poorly understood. In particular, the question of whether the PIP<sub>2</sub> cycle is a closed cycle with no net addition or loss of metabolites has not been addressed. Using mathematical modelling approaches, we find that a closed PIP<sub>2</sub> cycle cannot explain experimentally observed changes in the metabolic intermediates when changing enzyme activities in the PIP<sub>2</sub> cycle. Thus, we propose that the PIP<sub>2</sub> cycle likely includes at least one metabolic source and one sink whose net activity results in the experimentally observed regulation of this key signalling pathway.</p> <br> Fluctuation, Hydrodynamics, and confinement:  Stochastic dynamics in cells and tissues </br><br><p>Dynamics in cells and tissues are subjected to large mechanical stress fluctuations, originating from active processes, that consume chemical energy. In this thesis, the stochastic dynamics of inclusions embedded in a confined fluctuating medium is studied. Since the embedding medium is physically confined, the translational invariance of the inclusion is broken. This leads to position-dependent mobilities and fluctuation amplitudes. The analysis derives its novelty from the fact that, hydrodynamic interactions lead to a Langevin equation with multiplicative noise, whose behavior is dictated by nature of the noise - thermal or active. For active fluctuations the steady state probability distribution of the inclusion position and size is described by a long range effective attractive potential between the inclusion and the confining wall.</p> <br> A conserved sequence signature is essential for robust plant miRNA biogenesis </br><br><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, endogenous regulatory RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional silencing of target mRNAs. Plant miRNAs are usually 20-22-nt in length and are processed from precursors having a specific stem-loop structure that are recognized and cleaved by Dicer-like 1 (DCL1) with the help of dsRNA binding protein Hyponastic leaves 1 (HYL1) and a zinc finger protein named Serrate (SE). Plant miRNA stem-loops are very diverse in length and structure than animal miRNAs. It is very well known how only one or rarely more than one miRNAs are precisely processed from long precursors. Our results show that the miRNA/miRNA* sequences have higher GC composition than their precursors and this GC enrichment guides the precise processing of miRNAs from long precursors through specific binding by HYL1. We also show a direct application of this finding in increasing the efficiency of artificial miRNA technique, popularly used in plant functional genomic studies.</p> <br> Structure and function studies of Rieske oxygenase like dehydrogenases </br><br><p>Oxygenases are enzymes that oxidize a substrate using Oxygen from the air. Rieske group of oxygeases are enzymes that are characterized by the presence of an Iron Sulfur center and a mononuclear Iron center. The Iron Sulfur center accepts electrons from a electron donor and transfers the electrons to a mononuclear Fe center which activates Oxygen molecule. Published genome of Streptomyces coelicolor(A3) revealed the presence of a Rieske oxygenase-like gene, RedG. Through genetic experiments in Streptomyces the product of the RedG gene has been shown to be essential for the conversion of a compound Undecylprodigiosin to Streptorubin B by a regio- and stereospecific reaction. Although the mechanism by which addition of oxygen catalyzed by the Naphthalene dioxygenase (the most extensively studied Rieske oxygenase) is well understood, very little is known about the mechanism by which the Rieske-like dehydrogenases carry out the removal of hydrogen atoms and form a Carbon-Carbon bond. My work will be towards understanding how such a reaction is carried out.</p>
<p>In this Annual Work Seminar I shall be presenting my work in molecular cloning, recombinant expression and purification of a Rieske oxygenase like dehydrogenase from Streptomyces coelicolor (A3), annotated RedG. I shall discuss the problems faced at each step of the process and how luck and keen observation had helped resolve them and finally how the protein could be purified.</p> <br> Studying motor ensembles using DNA origami </br><br><p>Biological motion ranging from cell division to muscle contraction is mediated by motor proteins often working as ensembles rather than as single molecules. Cellular machinery has evolved both processive and non-processive motors, which may or may not cooperate with and among each other for efficient cellular function. In general, processive motors do not seem to show cooperativity in force generation and velocity while non-processive motors do. However, this is yet to be validated as a general phenomenon of all molecular motors, precisely due to lack of tool to study motors in a number controlled manner. Gliding assays and motor protein ensembles on liposomes, beads, etc. have been used, however the control over the motor number is not possible in these assays which makes them only qualitative.</p>
<p>Here, using DNA origami we have developed a tool to create DNA-motor ensemble system with up to 56 numbers of motors, and study its ensemble level motility behavior.</p>
<p>I will present preliminary motility data of muscle myosin II and discuss major challenges in the assay with such non-processive motors.</p> <br> Investigating the effects of replication origin on chromosomal architecture and gene expression in Escherichia coli. </br><br><p>Chromosomal replication through a single bidirectional origin is fundamental to bacterial physiology. Though the origin of replication is non-obligatory, it is at the center of many important features of the gene expression and genome organization. It influencing genome features such as strand bias, gene copy number, etcetera.</p>
<p>In bacteria such as Escherichia coli whose division time is lower than the replication time, multiple replication forks are initiated during one cell cycle. This causes a gene dosage gradient from the replication origin to the replication terminus. The replication origin also defines the leading and the lagging strands. Majority of the highly expressed genes are present on the leading strand. We ask that does the the position of the replication origin affect the global expression and genome structure?</p>
<p>To address this, we are perturbing the position of the origin by placing it at different locations or removing it altogether. We have developed strains with two origins at different positions in the chromosome. Genome sequencing of two of the strains having two origins has indicated that that the inserted origins have failed to initiate replication. This indicates that the initiation of replication requires a suitable local genomic environment. Transcriptome sequencing in exponential growth phase has shown a strong positive correlation of expression with growth rates. Where as under steady state conditions gene expression correlates weakly negatively with the growth rates.</p> <br> Neural circuit for bitter taste processing in Drosophila </br><br><p>In <em>Drosophila</em>, gustation is important for feeding, avoiding of toxic substances, recognizing mates and finding appropriate locations for egg laying. The neural circuits that process gustatory information in the central nervous system of flies are poorly characterized.</p>
<p>We are studying first order sensory interneurons that process information from sensory neurons for eliciting appropriate behavior. For this we have used a library of enhancer-Gal4 lines in behavioral gustatory screening. In this screen we have found numerous interneurons whose targeted activation results in deficits in the proboscis extension/retention response to natural gustatory stimuli.&nbsp; Among these interneurons we have identified a pair of sub esophageal cells, which receive input from bitter sensitive sensory neurons. Targeted activation of these interneurons causes abnormal responses to appetitive stimuli such as sugar and water. Further analysis of the structure and function using calcium imaging of these identified interneurons indicates that they play an important role in bitter taste perception and in the resulting inhibition of proboscis extension and feeding. The genetic identification of these interneurons now makes it possible to search for other interneurons that are synapticaly interconnected and make up the circuitry for bitter taste perception and aversion response.</p>

Several pathogens have been shown to employ deamidation as a subtle PTM to alter the normal functioning of specific eukaryotic host proteins. This modification is brought about by efffector enzymes called deamidases which catalyse the irreversible conversion of a specific glutamine residue in a target protein to glutamate. This results in a localised increase in the negative charge of the protein. While molecular and cellular phenotypes associated with deamidase acitivity have been well-characterised, mechanisms leading to the dysfunction of deamidated target proteins are currently unknown.</p>
<p>Cycle inhibiting factor (Cif) secreted by Burkholderia pseudomallei is a Type-III secretion system effector that causes the deamidation of ubiquitin (Ub) at glutamine (Q) 40. Cif activity causes dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and its cellular effects are manifested in the form of cell cycle arrest at G1/S and G2/M phases, formation of actin stress fibers and cell enlargement. We have investigated the mechanisms underlying ubiquitin inactivation by Cif deamidation using MD simulations, NMR spectroscopy and biochemical assays.</p> <br> MADS-box transcription factor : miR444 interaction during rice development </br><br><p>MADS-box transcription factors are involved in a wide range of plant growth and development. MIKC-type MADS-box proteins, a class of transcriptional regulators have been shown to play a key role in the determination of floral organ identity in many angiosperms. Rice is a monocot (and a model plant for all monocots) and a crop plant which shows high phenotypic variation among its landraces/varieties. RNA silencing mediated by regulatory small RNAs modulates gene expression at the post-transcriptional or transcriptional level. One of the small RNAs that is likely to be involved in rice flower development is miR444. Monocot-specific miR444 is an unusual class of miRNAs that are generated from antisense strand of their target genes. Their targets belong to a well-known class of MIKC-type MADS-box transcription factors, such as OsMADS23, OsMADS27, OsMADS57 and OsMADS61. In order to decipher the role of MADS-box proteins, over-expression of miR444 target mimic (miRNA sponge) and OsMADS61 transgenic lines were generated. Comparing to control, miR444 target mimic transgenic rice plants showed reduced seed setting rate and also up-regulation of miR444 targets. Like MADS-box protein, a novel transcription factor was identified recently in Arabidopsis named SHH1 (SAWADEE domain protein) which affects de novo DNA methylation globally and regulates gene expression. SHH1 is not functionally characterized yet in rice. To investigate its role, SHH1 over-expression and knock-down transgenic rice lines were generated. We use genetic and molecular tools to understand the role of MADS- box transcription factors and SHH1 in rice development.</p> <br> Olfactory control of cellular immunity via GABA shunt pathway </br><br><p>Immune challenge triggers several prompt and prolonged responses in the animal and blood system plays vital role in this interplay to safeguard the organism. Requirement of environmental signaling cues in guiding immune response to infection are not well explored in the past. With recent work in the lab, we have identified that sensing environmental odors is crucial for <em>Drosophila</em> to induce cellular immune response towards parasitoid wasps infection. Generally, wasps infection to <em>Drosophila</em> larvae triggers generation of specialized cell types termed lamellocytes which are important for enwrapment of parasitoid egg and melanization event to combat the attack. Interestingly, we found that this crucial event of generation of this cell type is dependent on a specific metabolic pathway termed GABA shunt. Upon olfactory stimulus, GABA as a metabolic signal releases from brain in the hemolymph which is subsequently taken up by blood cells to further catabolized it via GABA shunt pathway. The output of this catabolism then result into stabilization of a transcription factor called Sima (HIF 1alpha) which is necessary and sufficient for lamellocytes induction.<br /> Thus, overall this study describes the control of olfaction via neuronal signal on specific metabolic pathway within hematopoietic compartment to drive required immune response upon immune challenge condition. During my AWS i will shed light on the whole mechanism and physiological relevance of the study in detail.</p> <br> Systematic accumulation, domain architectures and taxonomic analysis of homologues of protein structural domains </br><br><p>Proteins of known structure have been classified into various hierarchies like class, fold, superfamilies and families in a public-domain compendium, Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP), but there are numerous sequences in the non-redundant sequence (NR) database for which structural information is not available. The structural space is composed of a limited number of folds and computational methods can be used to assign putative structural information to sequences. GenDiS is a database which tries to bridge the gap between the sequence space and structure space by using remote homology-based sequence searches.</p>
<p>Several remote homology detection methods were initially compared to come up with a search strategy for homology detection at the SCOP superfamily-level. A systematic accumulation of homologues of 1961 structural domains in SCOP v1.75 was carried out against NR. The hits were validated using structure-based sequence alignments of the superfamily members, finally covering nearly 18 million protein sequences.</p>
<p>A protein may be composed of single or multiple domains. The domain order of a protein is called its domain architecture (DA). For all the computationally validated hits, DA were ascribed at the structural (SCOP) and sequence-level (Pfam) domains. Thus, a correspondence was established between SCOP and Pfam domain definitions covering about 61% of Pfam domains and most of SCOP. The results for all the superfmilies in SCOP v1.75 will be available in the form of a database GenDiS+.</p>
<p>The taxonomic distribution of homologues from each superfamily was studied. The evolution of DA was also studied at the taxa-level using an in-house tool called ADASS (Alignment-free domain architecture similarity search). As a case study, the evolution of DA in myosin sequences and the identification and comparison of sequence motifs across different classes will be discussed.</p>
<p>I will be describing the sequence search strategy, validation of hits, assignment of DA, database features and the case of myosins.</p>

(Manuscript under review)</p> <br> Importance of Interaction Geometry of Aromatic Side Chains at the Protein Hydrophobic Core: A Lesson from SUMO </br><br><p>Key residues that dictate the topology of a protein fold are often found conserved in the hydrophobic core across different proteins of same fold. A proper arrangement of core amino acids is critical for efficient packing of hydrophobic side chains and hence the topology, substitution of these core residues often leads to altered thermodynamic parameters of a protein.</p>
<p>Aromatic amino acids because of its hydrophobic nature are commonly found inside the core of a protein or form a part of hydrophobic pocket at binding interfaces. Substitution at core positions can alter protein function and stability and has been widely studied through multiple approaches like computational alanine scanning to mutagenesis. While alanine scanning can reveal the importance of specific residues in a protein fold but cannot identify individual interactions of side chains which often get subsumed to the overall destabilization of the protein brought by alanine substitution. This becomes even more crucial for aromatic amino acids, where depending on the alignment of the aromatic rings the amino acids can form strong stabilizing interactions as well as repulsive destabilization in a protein core.</p>
<p>I will be presenting about such a case for SUMO proteins. In spite of high structural similarity between Ubiquitin and SUMO, we found that arrangement of aromatic residues inside SUMO is one of the critical interactions that distinguish SUMO proteins from other homologous UBL folds. From our biophysical studies, we also found that such interactions in SUMO cannot be supplemented by conservative substitutions with hydrophobic residues that share structurally similar positions of Ubiquitin and maintain a similar fold. We also found that the loss of this stabilizing Tyr Phe T shaped interaction results in a loss of function for SUMO.</p> <br> Tbx6 is a mesoderm switch in bipotent axial progenitors </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">In the embryos of birds and mammals, elongation along the body axis is supported by axial progenitors known as neuromesoderm progenitors (NMPs). NMPs are bipotent stem cells; they contribute to neural tube (spinal cord) and paraxial/somatic mesoderm (PM; musculoskeletal tissue precursor) below the forelimb. Although the mechanism maintaining these NMPs are known, the gene regulatory program governing their exit from progenitor state and the binary fate choice remains poorly understood. Our work has identified a novel progenitor population in the NMP niche marking a transient cell state as NMPs differentiate towards mesodermal fate. Besides occupying an anatomically defined progenitor subdomain, this population also marks the onset of Tbx6 expression, a key mesoderm fate determinant factor. Taken together with Tbx6 mutant and lineage tracing analyses, our findings provide compelling evidence that the population represents a transition state at the onset of fate commitment in NMPs. This work supports the model that Tbx6 functions as a mesoderm fate switch by inhibiting neural fate while activating the mesodermal pathway. With the objective of addressing how Tbx6 functions as mesodermal fate switch, I have identified its transcriptional targets by ChIP-sequencing. These findings have laid the framework to address the lineage progression and mesoderm fate choice in axial progenitors.</p> <br> In vivo Protein Crystallography: Exploring natureâ€™s gifted crystals </br><br><p>In vivo-grown protein crystals have been identified in a diverse group of organisms with varied biological functions. The studies on the in vivo crystals have been minimal in the past due to their small size limited by the volume of the cells or the respective in vivo compartment. Modern developments in X-ray crystallography including serial femtosecond crystallography and microcrystallography have made structure determination using micrometer-sized crystals relatively easier. We are interested in exploring three different in vivo crystals: milk protein crystals from Diploptera punctata, prophenol oxidase crystals from Drosophila melanogaster and seed storage proteins from pumpkin and rock melon seeds. These studies on the in vivo crystals will help us to understand the proteins in their native functional niche.</p>
<p>We have characterized in vivo milk protein crystals from developing embryos of the only viviparous cockroach, Diploptera punctata. These protein crystals provide 3-4X more energy than most mammalian milks as nourishment to the embryos. We are currently producing these milk proteins in vitro in yeast and developing them as potential supplements for human consumption.</p>
<p>In Drosophila, melanization is a major immune response at the site of infection and injury. Prophenol Oxidase (PPO) is a key enzyme for melanization that catalyzes the oxidation of phenols to quinones, finally polymerizing to melanin. Of the three PPOs produced, PPO2 form crystals inside crystal cells. We are interested in determining the structure of these crystals using diffraction from the entire crystal cells.</p>
<p>Plant seeds store very high concentrations of proteins in Protein Storage Vacuoles (PSVs), which are used during germination and seedling growth. Diffraction studies on pumpkin and rock melon seed slices have earlier shown that there are crystalline proteins present in them. Isolation of these crystals and their subsequent X-ray diffraction is a novel study that has been just initiated in our lab.</p> <br> Studying the in-vivo function of Phosphatidylinositol 5-phoshpate 4-Kinase isoforms through heterologous expression in Drosophila.	 </br><br><p></p>
<p>Phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinases (PIP4K) catalyze PI5P to produce PI(4,5)P2, a major phosphoinositide known to perform an array of signaling functions within the cell. PI5P 4-kinase plays a role in organismal development as demonstrated in the Drosophila null mutants (dPIP4K29). dPIP4K29 shows a delay in development which is correlated with cell size reduction as seen in salivary gland cells (Gupta et al., 2013).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike the Drosophila genome that has a single gene encoding for PIP4K activity (dPIP4K) mammalian genomes contain three genes that encode for the PIP4K activity - namely &alpha;, &beta; and &gamma;. A study by Clarke et al., in 2013 shows that these three isoforms have widely different specific activity as measured in-vitro. hPIP4Ka shows highest activity among the three isoforms, hPIP4Kb shows intermediate levels of activity and hPIP4Kg shows very less or close to no activity. We wanted to understand if in-vitro specific activity of these PIP4Ks can be correlated with their in-vivo function.</p>
<p>In Drosophila, we have previously shown that dPIP4K29 shows reduced salivary gland average cell size which can be rescued back by reconstituting a wild-type dPIP4K protein. We have generated UAS-transgenes for the three mammalian orthologues to study their effects in-vivo. For this, we do heterologous reconstitution of dPIP4K29 with mammalian orthologues singularly and observe for cell size reversion. We see that all three mammalian orthologues show rescue in cell size irrespective of their kinase activity measured in-vitro. This suggests that there could be other regulatory factors in-vivo which contribute to the functioning of the enzyme that needs to be further studied.</p>

<p></p> <br> Understanding the Role of D-E-A-D Box Protein, SMED-DDX24, in Planarian Regeneration. </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Planarian flatworms are well known for their extraordinary regenerative ability. Any fragment of their body lost to amputation or injury can regenerate into a fully functional mature animal in just two weeks! One major reason facilitating regenerative response in these worms is the presence of body wide pluripotent stem cells called neoblasts. Therefore, understanding the cell biology of these neoblasts and how these stem cells commit to various lineages is central to understanding the process of regeneration. Post transcptional gene regulation mediated by miRNAs, alternative polyadenylation, RNA binding proteins, etc, has been shown to play crucial role in maintainance of stemness, proliferation, and/or lineage fate decisions in planarians. D-E-A-D Box family of RNA binding proteins are well known effectors of RNA metabolism in wide range of metazoans. Planarian genome encodes for approximately 30 odd transcripts belonging to this protein family, expression of most of which is heavily enriched in neoblasts. Here, I talk about SMED-DDX24, a D-E-A-D Box family member, and its role in planarian photo-receptor regeneration. <em>ddx24</em> knockdown animals fail to regenerate photo-receptors and we are trying to understand in detail the exact role of this protein in this process.</p> <br> T-box factors regulate mesoderm patterning along anterior-posterior axis </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Mesoderm, one of the embryonic germ layers, is the source of numerous tissues like muscle, bone, blood, heart etc. While the downstream differentiation programs of these lineages are well studied, the genetic network governing the early fate decisions, which lay the foundation for lineage diversification is poorly understood. In vertebrates, progenitors of distinct mesoderm lineages progressively emerge at the primitive streak along the anterior-posterior (A/P) axis. Our mouse genetic studies underscore earlier findings that the T-box transcription factors T and Tbx6 play a key role in specification of the lineage-specific progenitors along A/P axis. T and Tbx6 are crucial for specifying a distinct mesoderm subtype posterior to the forelimbs. Based on previous reports, we hypothesize that Eomes, another T-box factor acts to specify mesodermal lineages anterior to forelimbs. To test this hypothesis, I am assessing the effect on anterior mesoderm specification upon loss-of-function of Eomes using a powerful embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation approach. Subsequently, I plan to systematically assess functional interactions between Eomes and T as well as T and Tbx6 using double mutants and ESC differentiation to dissect redundant and non-overlapping roles of the T-box transcription factors in regulating early mesoderm fate diversification. Integrating the study with parallel studies in our laboratory focusing on signaling cues driving early mesoderm fate commitment will reveal the genetic program regulating mesoderm patterning along the A/P axis.</p> <br> Multi-species connectivity in a fragmented landscape- theoretical predictions, empirical investigation and future simulations </br><br><p>Habitat destruction and fragmentation are the primary threats impacting mammals globally. Habitat destruction can lead to population decline in wild mammals and fragmentation can restrict connectivity or movement of species between habitat patches. Loss of connectivity can disrupt several ecological and evolutionary processes. For my PhD, I investigated connectivity in multiple species inhabiting a fragmented landscape. I used two main approaches: theoretical and empirical. Theoretical approach (using simulations) was used to investigate how connectivity in mammals with different life history traits might be affected by the surrounding landscape. Empirical data was used to examine the current connectivity in four sympatric species- jungle cat, leopard, tiger and sloth bear in the fragmented central Indian landscape. The theoretical and empirical approaches were combined to investigate how current connectivity might change in the study landscape in the future and under different development scenarios.</p> <br> Understanding functional pools of phosphatidylinositol 4,5- bisphosphate at the plasma membrane </br><br><p>Phosphatidylinositol 4,5- bisphosphate (PIP2) is a minor class of signaling lipid primarily found on the inner leaflet of plasma membrane. It can regulate a wide array of subcellular functions in this location simultaneously. PIP2 can directly bind to downstream effector proteins to regulate functions such as endocytosis and maintenance of cytoskeleton. Else, it can be hydrolyzed by enzymes such as phospholipase C to produce second messengers IP3 and DAG. It has been proposed that functionally distinct pools of PIP2 underlie the ability of a single molecule to regulate such diverse functions with high fidelity at the plasma membrane.&nbsp; The mechanism by which such pools might be generated and maintained remains disputed.</p>
<p>Work done in our lab suggests that functional pools of PIP2 might be maintained by the activity of&nbsp; &nbsp;distinct lipid kinases and phosphatases at the plasma membrane of Drosophila photoreceptors.&nbsp; The gene dPIP5K encodes a lipid kinase that produces a PLC sensitive pool of PIP2 involved in photo transduction. Another lipid kinase encoded by skittles is required to generate PIP2 required for housekeeping functions. The dPIP5K gene is spliced to generate multiple splice forms with a conserved lipid kinase domain and a variable C-terminus.&nbsp;&nbsp; We hypothesize that the variable C terminus regions of these dPIP5K variants mediate specific interactions with effector proteins leading to localized, context dependent production of PIP2.</p>
<p>Apart from the kinases, phosphatases, which can hydrolyze PIP2 back to PI4P, might also be involved in maintaining the PIP2 flux at the membrane. The functions of two PIP 5-ptases: dOCRL &amp; Synaptojanin is being investigated in this context. I would provide evidence for the genetic interaction between kinases and phosphatases during phototransduction and discuss their role in maintaining functional PIP2 pools.</p> <br> A tRNA modification pathway senses the metabolic state of the cell and integrates it with cell cycle progression </br><br><p>The decision of a cell to enter the cell cycle can be viewed primarily as a metabolic problem. Cells must appropriately sense available nutrients, and regulate their metabolic outputs, to enter and eventually complete the cell division process. However, specific mechanisms that couple metabolism with cell cycle progression are poorly understood. Our earlier work had suggested that a specific tRNA modification, which incorporates a thiol group on uridines present at the wobble-codon recognizing position (s2-U), acts to sense amino acid availability (Laxman et al Cell 2013). This tRNA modification appears to integrate amino acid homeostasis with cellular translational capacity. In this study, we observe that in the absence of these s2-U tRNA modifications, cells switch their metabolism to an apparent &ldquo;starvation state&rdquo;. By combining translational reporter assay, along with targeted, quantitative metabolite analysis and flux experiments, we find that this metabolic reprogramming results in an altered accumulation and utilization of amino acids and nucleotides. Our data suggests that this tRNA modification is important for directing increased carbon flux into the pentose phosphate pathway, absence of which results in decreased nucleotide synthesis, hypersensitivity to deoxyribonucleotide depleting agent, hydroxyurea and accumulation of storage carbohydrates trehalose and glycogen. As a consequence, this tRNA modification dependent metabolic switch delayed the cell cycle progression. Collectively, our results suggest that this s2-U tRNA modification plays a critical role in amino acid homeostasis and coupling nucleotide homeostasis with entry into the cell cycle.</p> <br> Understanding regeneration polarity & positional information establishment along the planarian Medio-lateral (M-L) axis. </br><br><p style="text-align: justify;">Planarian flatworms are well known for their extraordinary regenerative ability. Any fragment of their body lost to amputation or injury can regenerate into a fully functional animal in a couple of weeks! At the heart of this regeneration narrative lies (at least) two important factors: (1) distribution of body wide pluripotent stem cells and (2) presence of surveillance systems that can detect what organs/structures are present and what all are missing thereby elucidating a proper regenerative decision. Zooming in, key to this surveillance system is proper establishment of polarity at the wound surface. In our current study we aim to identify the polarity determinants along the medio-lateral (M-L) axis when a planarian is cut in sagittal (longitudinal) paradigm. We have been using surgical manipulations, RNA-seq, RNAi and whole mount insitu hybridization to answer this question. In addition, the broader goal of our study is to understand how positional information is specified and maintained along the planarian M-L axis during homeostasis and how the same is re-specified during regeneration.</p> <br> A promiscuous volatile bridging ion channels and pumps </br><br><p>Connections between the two cellular ion exchange pathways, channels and pumps, are vital for understanding basic biological processes that regulate life on Earth. We have identified a plant volatile, 2-methyltetrahydro-3-furanone, or coffee furanone, that is a common ligand for both the conserved sodium-potassium pump (Na<sup>+</sup> /K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase), and a multigene family of ligand-gated ion channels comprising insect olfactory receptors, eliciting chemosensory responses and, separately, toxicity across insect orders. Animals with modifications in the alpha subunit of Na<sup>+</sup> /K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase conferring resistance to cardiac glycosides were resistant to coffee furanone, indicating a similar molecular target for toxicity. Coffee furanone was also detected by chemosensory neurons of multiple species, including all neurons expressing the insect-specific olfactory receptor complex in&nbsp;<em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>,&nbsp;except for highly specialized receptors. This promiscuous volatile thus provides both a common ligand uniting a highly diverse chemoreceptor family, and opens a new field for identifying small molecules targeting the ubiquitous sodium-potassium pump.&nbsp;</p> <br> Sex life of butterflies: Does shape matter? </br><br><p>The external genitalia of insects exhibit a plethora of variation. These variations in morphology are markedly different among closely related species and have been used as taxonomic key characters to identify species. In insect groups like butterflies, the external genital morphology is even more complex and consists of multiple functional traits. But, why do such variations and complexities exist? What is the function of such varied genital characters? There are several proposed hypotheses about the underlying causal factors for these variations, but most of them are based on indirect evidence. Hence, to understand the divergence pattern and species-wise variation in genitalia morphology, we have dissected the males of several species of butterflies as male genitalia is historically better characterized than female genitalia. We are imaging in copula butterflies using Micro-CT to characterize parts of external genitalia in both males and females, which interact during mating and are probable candidates for functional traits under selection and undergoing rapid divergence. Additionally, mating insects are often compelled to move in copula to due predation pressure, &nbsp;and in most insect orders the actively flying partner is the female. However, some butterfly species exhibit a role reversal and the males are the active partners in these groups. This alteration in mating behaviour may be closely associated with genitalia morphology. We are also investigating how the &nbsp;interactions between mating pairs change with this shift in behaviour. In a larger context, changes in genitalia morphology lead to reproductive isolation and speciation. Therefore, this study will also provide significant understanding about how changes in genital morphology influence the fundamental processes of speciation.</p> <br> Environmental change can dramatically alter adaptive trajectories  </br><br><p>The rapid rate of environmental change worldwide is causing concern about the ability of natural populations to persist under changing conditions. In the face of a major environmental change, maladaptation to the novel environment may drive a population to extinction. However, populations may persist through evolutionary rescue &ndash; the process through which adaptive evolutionary change can restore positive growth to a declining population. In order to quantify the variation in dynamics of evolutionary rescue across populations, we used 10 wild-collected populations of the cosmopolitan generalist, <em>Tribolium castaneum</em>. We experimentally evolved triplicate lines in overlapping generations, selecting for performance on corn (a novel suboptimal resource). Over the course of this evolution, we collected census data for larval, pupal and adult stages for 30 generation cycles. Using these census data, we observe the classic U-shaped time series associated with evolutionary rescue - after about 13 generations, the populations' initially declining growth rates stabilized, and later dramatically increased. However, we find that this rescue also correlates very well with an incidental change in the texture of corn that we used to impose selection. After a few generations, when this was replaced with the original texture of the same resource, population growth rates began to decline again. This indicates that environmental changes, even within a selective regime, can dramatically alter adaptive trajectories. In this AWS, I will describe the change in demographic parameters of these populations over the course of the experimental (and accidental) evolution. These results suggest that during adaptation to a novel environment, population sizes may be strongly influenced by disturbances within this environment. Such disturbances may have the potential to reduce the demographic threat to a population in a novel environment and may aid subsequent adaptation.</p> <br> Chemistry and significance of wing colouration in Papilio polytes </br><br><p>Colour patterns are important sensory cues for both inter- and intra- specific interactions. In butterflies, wing colour patterns can be used for predator avoidance, thermoregulation or mate signalling. Colouration in butterflies can be due to structural features, pigmentary depositions or both. Papilio polytes, a female-limited Batesian mimic, shows the presence of fluorescent colour patches on the hind wings of the non-mimetic female and male forms, which is lost in the mimetic females. In order to identify the chemical nature of the fluorescence, we confirmed that it was pigment based colouration and we carried out extractions from the hind wings of these butterflies. We then standardized HPLC methods for chromatographic separation. We also ran the sample with an LC-MS pipeline and identified the fluorescent molecule to be Papiliochrome-II. Next, to determine functional or biological significance of the fluorescence, we designed a mate-choice behaviour experiment. In this experiment, we manipulated the fluorescent patch in the males and studied female choice for this fluorescent patch. In this AWS I will talk about the characterization of the fluorescent pigment and the results from the mate choice experiment.</p> <br> Bacterial communities associated with butterflies and their impact on butterfly fitness </br><br><p>A central focus of biological research is to understand the mechanisms leading to the enormous diversity of life. Host-microbe interactions are a potential driver of animal diversification because microbes can strongly impact crucial parameters such as host diet, mate-choice, fecundity, and survival. Thus, studying host-microbe interactions is important to understand host ecology, evolution, and behavior. Butterflies represent an excellent model to study host-microbe associations as they show great diversity in their diets, ecological niches and behavior. We tested bacterial community composition across life stages and across species of 12 butterfly hosts. We found that bacterial communities do not always change significantly with development, despite vastly different diets across stages. In contrast, dietary variation between species is strongly associated with distinct bacterial communities. Surprisingly, more specialist larvae have relatively similar microbiomes whereas the more generalist adults harbor very distinct bacterial flora. Thus, unexpectedly, adult butterflies seem to impose a stronger filter on their gut communities. Next, we tested the impacts of extracellular and intracellular bacteria on butterfly fitness. We found that in two butterfly species, eliminating dietary microbes had weak and variable fitness impacts indicating that butterflies do not have a strong beneficial association with their gut microbes. In contrast, we found that in one of these two host species, intracellular bacterium&nbsp;<em>Wolbachia</em>&nbsp;distorted adult sex ratio giving a strong female bias. Overall, in butterflies, obligate endosymbionts appear to play a larger role in governing the ecology and evolution of specific hosts, compared to very weak effects of non-obligate extracellular bacterial associates. In my talk, I will focus on the fitness impacts of gut bacteria and intracellular&nbsp;<em>Wolbachia&nbsp;</em>on butterflies.</p> <br> What are the roles of electrical and chemical transmission at a mixed synapse? </br><br><p>Neurons transmit electrical signals to one another at specialized structures called synapses, which can be either electrical (gap-junctions), chemical (neurotransmitter-based), or mixed (both electrical and chemical). These mixed synapses are commonly found in both vertebrate and invertebrate neural circuits, but remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>In the larval zebrafish, a pair of large reticulospinal neurons, called Mauthner neurons (or M-cells), controls the escape response, and receives mixed synaptic input. A single action potential in this cell is sufficient to elicit an escape response. Thus, the larval zebrafish escape circuit makes for an ideal model to ask what electrical and chemical synapses do at a mixed synapse, and how much of each is needed for the M-cell to fire.</p>
<p>To address this question, I am using a combination of in silico simulation and in vivo electrophysiology, which will be the subject of this time&rsquo;s AWS. From simulations, I predict that subthreshold electrical synapses can suppress the action of chemical synapses. I will also show recordings made using classical electrophysiology and dynamic clamp, to illustrate how I will address this question in vivo.</p> <br> Group I mGluR and NMDAR Create Distinct Bioenergetic and Translation Response with Different Kinetics </br><br><p>Vertebrate brain consumes almost ~20% of the total energy budget of the body and majority of the consumptions are thought to happen at the synapse.&nbsp; While endocytosis is considered as the major drain on energy at presynaptic terminus, very little is known on post-synaptic or global cellular energy consumptions on activity. We found activity dependent protein synthesis contributes significantly to energy consumption both at the post-synapse as well at a more global level in excitatory cortical neurons. Protein Synthesis downstream of glutamatergic pathways has been observed to be a major pre-requisite for various forms of synaptic plasticity, a process important for learning and memory. Since both Gp I mGluR and NMDAR regulate translation, we chose to study the effects of activation of the individual receptors on translation and energetics. Specific activation of Gp I mGluR caused a rapid translation activation and a concomitant reduction of the synaptic ATP levels. On the contrary, NMDAR stimulation lead to a biphasic translation response with a rapid translation inhibition phase followed by delayed translation activation phase. The ATP level in this scenario dropped late following delayed translation activation. In both cases, we found translation was regulated largely at the elongation phase which in turn had interesting correlation to the activity of AMP Kinase, a cellular energy/stress sensor. AMPK was observed to be inactivated immediately after mGluR stimulation in spite of an ATP drop. NMDAR stimulation on the other hand, lead to an activation of AMP Kinase in a calcium dependent manner without any change at the ATP level, thereby causing rapid translation inhibition. In Fmr1 KO animals (known to have aberrant mGluR activity), mGluR stimulation failed to elicit change in synaptic ATP level when compared to WT scenario. Therefore, our observations point to a tight regulation of bioenergy and translation on activity, which can potentially have crucial impact on neuronal development and plasticity. &nbsp;</p> <br> mGluR mediated synaptic plasticity in the lateral amygdala in a novel rat model of Fragile X Syndrome </br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGLuRs) have been a major target for the development of pharmaceutical interventions to treat Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), a common heritable form of autism. However, the majority of studies leading to these developments have focused on the hippocampus and the cortex. Despite emotional dysfunction being a major symptom of FXS, relatively little is known about how the amygdala, a key structure mediating emotional salience, is affected in FXS. Previous studies have shown that the direction of mGluR-dependent change in synaptic strength (i.e. potentiation versus depression) and its aberration (impairment versus enhancement) in <em>Fmr1</em> KO mice are opposite in the amygdala compared to the hippocampus (<em>Suvrathan and Chattarji 2011</em>,). The goal of the present study is to understand the synaptic basis of mGluR plasticity in the amygdala and its contribution to the pathophysiology of Fragile X Syndrome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using whole-cell patch clamp recordings from principal neurons in the lateral amygdala, we demonstrate deficits in presynaptic release and synaptic plasticity in a novel rat model of FXS. We find that lateral amygdala neurons in <em>Fmr1</em> KO rats have a lower frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) and a deficit in long-term potentiation (LTP) at their thalamic inputs. This is coupled to a decrease in surface expression of postsynaptic NMDA and AMPA receptors in these neurons. We also find an impairment in amygdala-dependent auditory fear memory in <em>Fmr1</em> KO rats. While <em>chronic inactivation</em> of mGluRs has previously been used to rescue some of the symptoms of FXS, we used a complementary strategy of <em>acute mGluR activation</em> to identify specific changes in intrinsic excitability and synaptic plasticity in amygdala neurons. Acute activation of mGluRs with a specific agonist (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), was sufficient to increase synaptic excitability and LTP at thalamic inputs to lateral amygdala neurons. Intra-amygdaloid infusions of DHPG also enhanced a weak auditory fear memory in a cue specific manner. Can we then use this same strategy of mGluR activation to rescue the deficits in amygdala plasticity seen in <em>Fmr1</em> KO rats? We find that an acute treatment with DHPG does rescue the frequency of mEPSCs as well as the impaired LTP in lateral amygdala neurons of <em>Fmr1</em> KO rats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, our findings provide a new framework for mGLuR plasticity in the amygdala and demonstrate a novel strategy to leverage this plasticity in the treatment of FXS. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <br> Metabolic dependencies explain genome flexibility in prokaryotes </br><br><p>Even across genomes of the same species, prokaryotes exhibit remarkable flexibility in gene content. We do not know whether this flexible or &ldquo;accessory&rdquo; content is mostly neutral or adaptive, largely due to the lack of explicit analyses of accessory gene function. Here, across 96 diverse prokaryotic species, we show that a considerable fraction (~40%) of accessory genomes harbours beneficial metabolic functions. These functions take two forms: (1) they significantly expand the biosynthetic potential of individual strains, &nbsp;and (2) they help reduce strain-specific metabolic dependencies via intra-species metabolic exchanges. We find that the potential of both these functions increases with increasing genome flexibility. Together, our results support a predominantly adaptive role for prokaryotic pangenomes.</p> <br> The Hamming Model to study the stable states of Biological systems </br><br><p>Biological systems have been studied for long as complex interacting systems.</p>
<p>Most of the molecular processes inside the cells are controlled by gene expressions. The distinct fate of cell in multicellular organism, the switching behavior of cells such as proliferation or differentiation into specialized cell types are all controlled by genome wide gene regulatory network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;So essentially, hundreds of interactions go simultaneously among thousands of genes, which give rise to such complex network. In such complex interacting systems there are multiple fixed points possible. What I&rsquo;m asking here is 1) what network structures are possible? 2) What is the nature of fixed points of such network? 3) How resilient are such networks? 4) How to write the functional form, which gives rise to such network structure? &nbsp;5) What can we infer about the gene interactions from the functional form?</p> <br>  Factors affecting variation in mating success of males in blackbuck lek. </br><br><p>Leks are communal display grounds on which males aggregate during breeding season to defend small, clustered, resource-less territories, that females visit to choose mates. The number of matings is highly skewed towards the centre of the lek with 70-80% of matings occur at the centre. Strong mating bias towards the centre of the lek suggests a positional bias in female choice and a centripetal variation in the quality of males. The difference in male quality can be assessed by females through several cues like morphology, behaviour, auditory and olfactory signals. The Indian blackbuck (Antilope cerviacpra) is the only lekking mammal endemic to the Indian Subcontinent and is a good system to investigate factors affecting female choice.&nbsp;<br />Male blackbucks on the lek spend a lot of time in making and maintaining dung piles. Females who visit the lek for mating also spend considerable amount of time sniffing these dung piles. This suggests that chemical cues from the territorial dung piles may play a significant role in female choice. In this study, we have developed a protocol for large scale&nbsp;in situ sampling and analysis of volatiles potentially involved in chemical signalling. We identified a chemical meta cresol as an important infochemical in blackbuck mating and tested its impact on males and females by odor choice experiments using captive blackbuck. To assess individual level variation in mating success, we developed genetic markers to identify individuals in a lek and estimated spatio-temporal variation in male occupancy of the lek.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <br> A cluster of miRNAs regulate MYB repressors to promote anthocyanin and flavonol accumulation in grapes </br><br><p>Anthocyanins are plant compounds that are required for attracting pollinators and for seed dispersal. These phenolic compounds also help the plants to defend against the biotic and abiotic stresses. Limited studies in Arabidopsis and apple have shown a likely involvement of specific microRNAs in anthocyanin development (Pant et al., 2011, Xia et al., 2012) through targeting MYB transcription factors. The miRNAs identified as key for anthocyanin synthesis are less conserved and abundant only in specific plants, indicating a species-specific regulation. We find that three less conserved miRNAs with the potential to target MYB transcription factors are highly abundant in grapes (Vitis vinifera) and other fruits with high anthocyanin content. More than 60% of all R2R3 MYB transcription factors from Vitis are predicted targets of these miRNAs. In order to understand the specific role of these miRNAs in anthocyanin development, we took advantage of three different coloured grapes with varying anthocyanin content. Using small RNA-sequencing, mRNA-seq and proteomic analysis, we establish that grape lines with high anthocyanin content express abundant MYB-targeting miRNAs resulting in differential expression of MYB proteins. All 3 miRNAs target coding sequences of specific helix motifs in the mRNA sequences of MYB proteins. Targeting by a 22-nt miRNA caused induction of secondary silencing cascade that is dependent on RDR6.&nbsp; MYB suppression and cascade silencing was more robust in grape lines with high anthocyanin content when compared to a flavonol-rich grape line. We establish that in grape lines with high miRNAs mediate silencing of repressor class of MYBs to promote anthocyanin biosynthesis, while grape lines without robust silencing resulted in flavonol biosynthesis. Our results pave way for artificial enhancement of these key antioxidant compounds among plants by regulating specific MYBs involved in anthocyanin production.</p> <br> Nucleophilic catalytic platforms to alleviate pesticide-induced AChE inhibition, neuro-toxicity and mortality </br><br><p>In last three years, 442 farmer deaths due to pesticide exposure were reported in India. In 2017 an organophosphate named Monocrotophos alone was responsible for taking 50 lives in Maharashtra. Organophosphate-based pesticides inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) which plays a pivotal role in neuromuscular functions. While spraying in the field, farm workers get exposed to pesticides majorly through dermal and inhalation route. Internalized pesticide inhibits AChE which leads to neurotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, cognitive dysfunction, loss of endurance, and death in severe cases. General practices include covering the body minimally with normal fabric that has minimal protective ability while inhalation exposure is overlooked. Usual fabric absorbs pesticide droplets and increases dermal contact while adding the possibility of exposure during washing and storage. We have developed an array of prophylactic technologies with nucleophilic pyridine-aldoxime-functionalized dermal cream, facial mask and clothes that can instantly detoxify pesticide molecules.</p>
<p>I will be presenting the development and extensive <em>in vivo</em> characterization of these prophylactic measures. Together, these measures can completely prevent exposure to pesticides in farm workers and protect them from its toxic effects.</p> <br> Modulation of Protein Stability and Folding Cooperativity by Cosolvents </br><br><p>Proteins are dynamic molecules, and sample a variety of open conformations. The open conformations expose either one or a few amide sites to solvent, or, occasionally the amide sites of the entire polypeptide chain. Often structural opening events in proteins are transient and hence, are difficult to characterize. Thus, a range of physicochemical perturbants are used to study protein folding, and each perturbant provides important insights into the nature of the protein folding reaction. Some of the perturbants, which are widely used in the protein folding field to reversibly fold/unfold proteins, are cosolvents such as urea, GdnHCl, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), as well as various sugars. It remains an open question in the protein folding field as to how cosolvents affect protein stability and dynamics. Furthermore, it remains to be understood whether cosolvents just facilitate or actively modulate the intrinsic dynamics of the protein.</p>
<p>Recent studies have shown that protein folding has reduced cooperativity. Reduced cooperativity implies that the protein folds via discrete (or continuum of) intermediate states. It is not known whether folding and unfolding of each intermediate state is cooperative (all or none) or gradual in nature. Furthermore, it is not known how protein sequence, stability and (co)solvent conditions affect protein folding cooperativity. Recently, by use of the HX-MS (hydrogen exchange coupled to mass spectrometry) methodology, it has been shown that protein folding cooperativity is strongly coupled to protein stability.</p>
<p>In my thesis work the PI3K SH3 domain was used as a model system. The major findings of this thesis are summarized below.</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Under native-like conditions, the PI3K SH3 domain samples both kinds of structural openings: non-cooperative (gradual) openings as well as cooperative openings. The observation of cooperative unfolding suggests &nbsp;barrier-limited unfolding of the protein</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By measuring the pH dependence of the HX kinetics, it is seen that under the native conditions, the PI3K SH3 domain exchanges in the EX1 regime of HX.</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A linear four state mechanism (N&harr;IN&harr;I2&harr;U) is the simplest kinetic scheme which can explain all the mass distribution data under native conditions.</p>
<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the RT-loop, nSrc-loop, b strands 4 and 5 unfold non-cooperatively, while b strands 1, 2 and 3 unfold cooperatively under native conditions.</p>
<p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PI3K SH3 domain samples the same conformational space in the absence and presence of urea. Urea only decreases the activation energy (barrier height) of unfolding, and it increases the cooperativity of unfolding.</p>
<p>6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The unfolding of b strand 4 changes from being non-cooperative in the absence of urea to being cooperative in the presence of 5 M urea.</p>
<p>7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TMAO induced stabilization decreases protein folding cooperativity.</p>
<p>8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon large stabilization (2 M TMAO), the unfolding of the PI3K SH3 domain completely loses its cooperative nature, and samples the unfolded state in a gradual (diffusive), non-cooperative manner (Jethva and Udgaonkar, 2018a, manuscript under preparation).</p>
<p>9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the presence of GdnHCl, the PI3K SH3 domain samples the same conformational space as it samples in the absence and presence of urea. By measuring the native state dynamics in the presence of different concentrations of GdnHCl, it is shown that GdnHCl induces a parallel pathway for the formation of IN.</p>
